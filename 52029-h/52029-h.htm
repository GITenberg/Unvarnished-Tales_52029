<i>A QUEER QUEST</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the <i>Times</i> newspaper of
Monday, 1st July, 18&ndash;, there appeared a notice of Mr.
White&rsquo;s last novel.&nbsp; The notice&mdash;for one cannot
dignify with the name of review an article which did not exceed a
quarter of a column&mdash;contained the following
sentence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. White&rsquo;s novels appear to us to
lack but one element.&nbsp; Having achieved that one thing
needful, Mr. White at once and without cavil takes his place in
the first rank of modern novelists.&nbsp; In one word, Mr. White
must learn to study Human Nature from the life.&nbsp; His
characters are too often evolved from his inner consciousness,
and as beings thus produced are apt to be wanting in backbone, it
is not surprising that many of this popular <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>author&rsquo;s
works are weak and flabby&mdash;shadows without
substance&mdash;pictures without colour.&nbsp; If Mr. White were
to give one-half of the time to the study of the men and women by
whom he is surrounded, which he gives to the elaboration of plot
and the cultivation of style, we do not know that there is any
seat in the republic of letters which we would deny
him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. White was a timid gentleman, with thin reddish
hair&mdash;a very tall forehead and weak eyes.&nbsp; He was also
a very well tailored man, and lived in a neatly-appointed villa,
in the Hilgrove Road, St. John&rsquo;s Wood, N.W.&nbsp; He was
married, but had no children.&nbsp; He was by profession a
briefless barrister, but he made his name by writing
novels.&nbsp; It so happened that the public applauded Mr. White
from the very first moment that he appealed to them&mdash;at
least in book form: his tentative efforts in periodicals having
fallen very short of creating a <i>furor</i>.&nbsp; <i>His</i>
nonsense, which, it must be confessed, was not of a very
rollicking description, suited <i>their</i> nonsense.&nbsp; And
that was the whole secret of his success.&nbsp; Being a very
industrious man, he wrote a great many fictions, and being modest
withal, <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>attributed his fame to hard work rather than to any
endowment of genius.</p>
<p>When Mr. White neglected his grilled bone, his buttered toast,
his hot coffee, and his new-laid egg, and seemed spell-bound by
what appeared in the <i>Times</i> newspaper, his wife
instinctively knew that there was a notice of her husband&rsquo;s
book in that great organ, and she guessed by the twitching of his
mouth, and the flushing of his face, that the notice was the
reverse of favourable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true.&nbsp; It is quite true,&rdquo; said
Mr. White, aloud, but to himself, as he laid the paper down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is quite true?&rdquo; asked Mrs. White, who, while
greatly appreciating the pecuniary results of her husband&rsquo;s
labour, had but little sympathy with the work itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all wrong,&rdquo; he replied, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&nbsp; What is the matter with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wanting in backbone,&rdquo; he explained,
gloomily&mdash;&ldquo;criminally deficient in
backbone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, John, you must be mad,&rdquo; said the wife of his
bosom.&nbsp; And, indeed, there was a seeming irrelevancy in his
remarks, <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>which favoured his helpmate&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; But
John knew quite well what <i>he</i> was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Edward to fetch my coat and hat,&rdquo; he said,
having trifled with his breakfast instead of eating it like a
Briton; &ldquo;and lend me your scissors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dutiful young woman handed her lord and master the
scissors, with which he proceeded to cut out the <i>Times</i>
review&mdash;the which, when carefully abstracted, he placed in
his pocket-book.&nbsp; But before Edward came with his coat and
hat, Mrs. White, with natural and justifiable curiosity
asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going so early, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said John, quoting from the article,
&ldquo;I am going among the men and women by whom I am
surrounded.&nbsp; I am going to study human character from the
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. White shrugged her little shoulders, elevated her little
eyebrows, kissed her husband, and when she heard the hall-door
close behind him, she said very quietly, as though she were
making an observation which did not affect her even
remotely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to study <i>me</i> very
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>John
White&rsquo;s great crony was Anthony Lomax, of Paper
Buildings.&nbsp; And John White took a ticket to the Temple
Station, being determined to consult his old friend on this new
revelation which the great <i>Times</i> newspaper had opened up
to him.&nbsp; He was fortunate in finding Mr. Lomax at home,
devouring a frugal meal of brandy and soda, preparatory to
appearing before Vice-Chancellor Bacon in the celebrated case of
Breeks <i>v.</i> Woolfer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said John White, with characteristic
modesty, &ldquo;you see I never thought of achieving a first
rank.&nbsp; My books take well and I make money&mdash;thank
heaven.&nbsp; But this fellow in the newspaper absolutely says
that I am possessed of genius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t <i>I</i> always said it?&rdquo; asked
Tony, with an offended air; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t we all always
said it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but you are friends, don&rsquo;t you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&nbsp; Do I ever tell Jones that he has
genius?&nbsp; Do I ever tell Sandford that he has
genius&mdash;although he <i>is</i> a Fellow of Merton?&nbsp; Did
I ever tell Barlow that his <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>works would set the Thames on
fire?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Friendship in my case never interferes
with strict impartiality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pleased Mr. White.&nbsp; He absolutely blushed with
pleasure.&nbsp; A kind word from Lomax was more real satisfaction
to him than a page of praise from the <i>Sultry
Review</i>&mdash;which is not, perhaps, rating the eulogy of Mr.
Lomax very highly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they right about the&mdash;the want of
backbone?&rdquo; he inquired, nervously, &ldquo;and the necessity
to study character from the life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As right as nine-pence, my boy.&nbsp; Doctors analyse
dead bodies, and pull live ones about.&nbsp; Artists draw, I am
told, from the nude.&nbsp; Actors imitate particular
individuals.&nbsp; Yes, I think the <i>Times</i> rascal is
absolutely right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall commence and study from the life at
once.&nbsp; But where now,&rdquo; he asked plaintively,
&ldquo;where would you advise me to commence?&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know of any very likely place for the acquirement of
the backbone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, there&rsquo;s Breeks and Woolfer; if
you&rsquo;ll step over to the Vice-Chancellor&rsquo;s <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Court&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite full of
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the novelist only shuddered at the mention of the case,
and saying gently that he thought he would take his own course,
bade his friend &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and departed much
disturbed in his mind at the magnitude and amount of the task the
censor of Printing-house Square had set for him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Three months and a couple of weeks had passed away.&nbsp; It
was now the 15th of October, 18&ndash;, and Tony Lomax once more
sat in his chambers.&nbsp; He had been away for his holidays, and
had just returned, brown and invigorated, and ready to grapple
with and subdue that insatiable monster, &ldquo;Breeks and
Woolfer.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sitting with his legs stretched well
under his table, his coat was off notwithstanding the chilliness
of the weather, and his white shirt-sleeves were rolled up to his
elbows.&nbsp; He looked the picture of rude health and high
animal spirits.</p>
<p>A feeble knock on the panel of his door.&nbsp; A loud and
cheery &ldquo;Come in&rdquo; from Tony.&nbsp; The door opened,
and Mr. White entered, glanced <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>nervously round, and gliding up to
Lomax, said in a whisper,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lomax could hardly believe his eyes.&nbsp; The dapper little
friend of his youth had grown prematurely old.&nbsp; His thin red
hair was no longer neatly arranged.&nbsp; His weak eyes had a
wild and nervous shifting.&nbsp; His hands moved
convulsively.&nbsp; His lips were dry, and his throat&mdash;to
judge from his voice&mdash;parched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lomax, starting from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said the other, in extreme agitation,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak so loudly.&nbsp; <i>They might hear
you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who might hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The human characters&mdash;from the
life&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know.&nbsp; I have plenty of backbone
now&mdash;too much, Tony.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lomax saw how it was, attempted to calm him, and induced him
to take a seat, and to release his hat from his trembling
fingers.&nbsp; Then he said, with something of a tremor in his
voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, old man, tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John White looked nervously about the room, again asked
whether they were quite alone, <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and commenced, in a husky whisper, to
tell his narrative, with awful rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all right at first, Tony, and I made some
capital notes, but in a few days I tired.&nbsp; All the human
characters seemed so much alike when studied in the life.&nbsp;
So brutally alike.&nbsp; It pained me.&nbsp; The monotony of it
made me giddy.&nbsp; But then the worst came, Tony.&nbsp;
Whenever I went out to study a character&mdash;from the
life&mdash;the character began to study me.&nbsp; I tried to
brave it and bear up against it, because you know, Tony, the
<i>Times</i> said I had genius and only wanted backbone.&nbsp;
But just fancy to yourself setting out to study murderers and
thieves, and all sorts and conditions of unmentionable men, and
the murderers and thieves and unmentionables&mdash;from the
life&mdash;turning round and studying you!&nbsp; What do you
think of that?&nbsp; Study <i>you</i>&mdash;d&rsquo;ye
hear?&mdash;from the life!&nbsp; Ay, and follow you, too&mdash;to
your club, to your home:&mdash;to your very bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trembling hands searched for the hat.&nbsp; Mr. White had
jumped from his chair, and uttered a wild shriek, that sounded
like &ldquo;<i>Here they are</i>&mdash;<i>from the
life</i>,&rdquo; and had fled out on to the pavement of Paper
Buildings.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Poor
White died at Hanwell just two years ago&mdash;and Lomax married
his widow.&nbsp; She, poor creature, finds in her new husband a
practical person, whom she can understand, and seems all the
happier for the change.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>II.<br
/>
<i>THE SAWDUST MAN&rsquo;S CURSE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Harp Alley</span> is a little nagged
passage nestling under the heavy shadows of Drury Lane
Theatre.&nbsp; None of the merchants who pursue business in the
reeking enclosure can be truthfully described as doing a roaring
trade.&nbsp; A manufacturer of spangles, who has hidden his
commercial light under the bushel of Harp Alley, does a brisk
business during the months preceding Christmas&mdash;his stock
being in great demand for the decoration of the gorgeous
characters of Pantomime.&nbsp; No one ever stops at the old book
shop, where the same old plays which were offered ten years ago
in a box at a penny each are offered at a penny still.&nbsp; And
a steel engraving of David Garrick as Richard the Third, greatly
perturbed <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>by apparitions, has during the same interval failed to
find a purchaser at half-a-crown.&nbsp; There is an old clothes
shop in the Alley, owned by an adventurous speculator of the
Semitic persuasion, where you can borrow a dress suit for the
evening, and become a magnificent swell on the new hire
system.</p>
<p>The best trade done in Harp Alley is done by the owner of the
&ldquo;Piping Bulfinch&rdquo;&mdash;a public-house much resorted
to in the present day by scene-shifters, stage carpenters,
property men, and other humble ornaments of the British Drama,
with a fine capacity for four ale and bad language.&nbsp; At the
time of this story, the inner bar of the &ldquo;Piping
Bulfinch&rdquo;&mdash;a reserved space with a door marked
&ldquo;private&rdquo;&mdash;was the resort of certain actors and
authors having a greater wealth of brain than of pocket.&nbsp; In
those days the cuff-shooter was not, and a <i>jeune premier</i>
would be satisfied with something less than the wages of an
ambassador.&nbsp; Only the very superior sort of actor and
manager and dramatic author belonged to a Club.&nbsp; The rank
and file met unostentatiously in bars, and did their business <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>or criticised
their neighbours over &ldquo;goes&rdquo; of gin and whiskey, or
half pints of ale and stout.&nbsp; I do not intend to mention
here the names of those who were wont to meet of an afternoon at
the &ldquo;Piping Bulfinch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some are dead.&nbsp;
Some are alive and famous.&nbsp; Others are alive and
wrecks.&nbsp; And all of them seem desirous to forget the
struggling period when they patronised the snug but sombre
hostlery in Harp Alley.</p>
<p>Informally established as a <i>r&eacute;union</i>, this little
society became known to the outer world, and the gentle layman
penetrated to the recesses of the inner bar and forced his
babbling company upon the playwright and the player.&nbsp; So
that in self-defence the mummers and the drama-makers hired from
the landlord of the &ldquo;Piping Bulfinch&rdquo; a large room
that opened off the public bar.&nbsp; Towards defraying the
expenses, each member of the coterie subscribed one shilling per
week.&nbsp; They had a room of their own.&nbsp; They were now a
Club; and that is the true history of the establishment of the
Otway&mdash;for such was the style and title which these able but
impecunious men of genius gave to this Association, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>when
shrinking from contact with the profane vulgar, they withdrew
behind the closed door of their own private and particular
room.</p>
<p>And every Wednesday came to be known as Sawdust Day.</p>
<p>In those days of struggle what small incidents afforded
interest and even excitement! and the weekly advent of the man
bearing the sack of sawdust which was to be sprinkled on the
floor of the Club-room, was looked forward to with keen
enjoyment.&nbsp; He was a strange reflective man&mdash;the man
who bore in this weekly sacrifice to respectability&mdash;this
thin and shifting substitute for a carpet&mdash;this indoor
Goodwin sands.&nbsp; But he greatly prized the opportunity
afforded him of entering the Club.&nbsp; He laughed respectfully
(to himself) at the jokes which were bandied about.&nbsp; He
accepted with gratified smile the chaff which was levelled at him
and at his sawdust.&nbsp; He became indeed a part of the Club
itself, and lengthened his weekly visit as much as possible,
always discovering, when it appeared time to go, some refractory
spot on the floor which required replenishing and
smoothing.&nbsp; The Sawdust man may have been a broken <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>down
dramatist, a poor poet whose literary wares were a drug in the
market; and here in this bright association of wits and good
fellows he found solace once a-week.</p>
<p>Twelve happy months sped over the grey locks and closely
shaven features of the Sawdust man.&nbsp; And the fifty-two days
of congenial fellowship&mdash;so, poor man, he chose to consider
it&mdash;compensated for the three hundred and thirteen other
days upon which he sprinkled the yellow refuse among the
unsympathetic feet of the market-men in the public-houses about
Covent Garden.&nbsp; Pride, we are credibly informed, led to the
overthrow of the Prince of Darkness; and Pride entering into the
bosom of a new member of the Otway led to eventual decline and
fall of that remarkable society.&nbsp; In an evil moment it was
proposed at a meeting of the Committee that the Club-room should
be carpeted!&nbsp; After a long and angry discussion the
resolution was carried by a bare majority.&nbsp; The carpet was
purchased, and the poor dealer in the waste of the saw-pits was
dismissed for ever from the only Paradise of which he had any
knowledge.</p>
<p>Not unchallenged, however, was the innovation.&nbsp; <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>A few days
after the dismissal of the weekly visitor, the following letter
was received by the Secretary of the Club.&nbsp; It was duly
affixed to the notice-board above the mantel-piece, where for
some time it afforded the greatest amusement to the members, and
was provocative of many <i>faceti&aelig;</i> on the part of the
chartered wags.&nbsp; But there were some of the older ornaments
of the Otway, I think, who regarded the document with some
misgiving, and counted it as an ill omen.&nbsp; Here is the text
of the Awful Denunciation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">To the Otways</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Pride comes before a
fall</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware!&nbsp; You are haughty now.&nbsp; You will soon
be humble.&nbsp; My curse is upon you.&nbsp; For you have driven
me forth into the world&mdash;alone.&nbsp; May your Club be
overrun by outsiders.&nbsp; May money rule you instead of
brains.&nbsp; May your skill fail you and your wit wither
away.&nbsp; May you be abandoned by the pewter and the
pipe.&nbsp; May your plays be damned, and your articles
rejected.&nbsp; And aping your betters, may you become the
laughing stock of the world.&nbsp; [Signed]</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
Sawdust Man</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is insanity in Sawdust,&rdquo; said Gadsby, after
he had read the startling anathema.</p>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;More drunk than mad, I expect,&rdquo; suggested
the charitable Tapham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swallowed his own sack, perhaps,&rdquo; added Ponsonby,
in defence of the latter theory.</p>
<p>But old and judicious Otways shook their heads and
sighed.&nbsp; The Sawdust man had become a part of their artistic
career.&nbsp; His removal affected them.&nbsp; His curse
depressed them beyond measure.&nbsp; On the morning after the
receipt of the Curse, the members arriving at the Club found out
in the upper panel of the door the word</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ichabod</span>.</p>
<p>No one was ever able to ascertain when or how this amateur
wood-carving had been accomplished.&nbsp; It was a mystery.&nbsp;
But it led to this result.&nbsp; Senior members of the Otway
entertained some fine old crusted superstitions, and after this
handwriting on the door began to agitate for a removal to more
commodious apartments.&nbsp; And now the curse began to
work.&nbsp; For in order to keep up the more commodious rooms,
and to pay for the increased service, there were necessitated two
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>things.&nbsp; In the first place, an increased entrance
fee and subscription, and in the second place, a certain healthy
relaxing of the first rule of the Club, whereby all those who
were not professionally connected with art, literature, or the
drama, were rigorously excluded.</p>
<p>In two years from the date of the instalment of the Club in
its more commodious chambers, the institution had grown
marvellously in respectability, but it had lost its character,
and was now a collection of individuals of the most various and
most nondescript kind.&nbsp; And at the end of the last of those
two years, a gentleman was elected to membership, who worked with
the utmost good-will to efface what little traces of Bohemian
beginnings still clung about the Otway.&nbsp; About this person
or his antecedents little was known.&nbsp; He was immensely
wealthy.&nbsp; He had suddenly acquired his money.&nbsp; And his
qualification as a member of the Club was a work on Papua and New
Guinea, which had been eagerly welcomed by the learned societies,
had been solemnly reviewed by the <i>Quarterly</i>, and which was
known by several to be the work, not of the new member at all,
but of a Museum hack <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>named Geyser, who for a consideration
in hard cash, permitted Mr. Thistleton&mdash;that was the new
member&rsquo;s name&mdash;to figure on the title.&nbsp; Appended
to his name were the letters F.R.G.S., and other formidable
distinctions which it may be presumed, can also be obtained by
the common commercial operation known as exchange and barter.</p>
<p>Shortly after the advent of this great man, questions arose as
to the propriety of drinking beer out of pewter in the
Club-rooms.&nbsp; And as Mr. Thistleton was always ready to stand
a bottle of wine to anybody who cared to call for it, the
consumption of beer fell steadily off, and it became in time, the
very worst possible sort of form for an Otway to be seen imbibing
the produce of hops.&nbsp; Clay pipes had long ago been
disestablished by a by-law of the committee.&nbsp; Cigars at
ninepence and a shilling were supplied for the post-prandial
smoke.&nbsp; And it was an understood thing that members should
always dine in evening dress.&nbsp; When this rule came into
force, it occasioned the withdrawal of some old Otways, who,
although eminent in their particular walks of literature and art,
hadn&rsquo;t got a single dress-suit among <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&rsquo;em.&nbsp; The places of these talented but
socially incomplete persons were speedily filled by gentlemen
who, if devoid of genius, were possessed of dress suits of the
very latest design, and had gold and silver and precious
stones.&nbsp; And the flash of a diamond is, I take it, a much
more agreeable scintillation than the flash of the greatest wit
in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Thistleton not only elevated the members of the Otway by
means of champagne of great price; he endeavoured to give them
reflected glory by inviting to the house-dinner personages of
repute in Society.&nbsp; A Cabinet Minister once dined with
him.&nbsp; At another time, an Indian Prince, dressed in the most
gorgeous Oriental toggery, sat down to the Otway repast.&nbsp;
Indeed, there seemed to be, practically, no limit to his
influence with the great ones of the earth, and it was apparently
his delight to exert that influence, with a view of introducing
his brother members to all that was esteemed, wealthy, and wise,
in London Society.</p>
<p>At last there visited England an Indian Prince, compared to
whom the other Indian princes were mere nobodies.&nbsp; This
mighty <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>potentate was in due course brought down to the Otway,
and was graciously pleased to express his approval of all that he
saw and heard.&nbsp; And the Club, in order to show its
appreciation of the compliment of the wise man from the East,
invited him to a banquet.&nbsp; Princes have an awkward habit of
making requests that are commands.&nbsp; And when dinner was over
this dusky heathen had induced the members of the Club to
guarantee him a donation of five thousand pounds, towards his
fund for providing tom-toms for the Nautch girls of
Hindustan.&nbsp; Their solemn word was given to their
copper-coloured guest.&nbsp; There was no retreating from their
promise.&nbsp; The sequel is soon told.&nbsp; In order to raise
the amount the effects of the Otway were offered at public
auction.&nbsp; All the members attended the sale, and watched
their works of art, their luxurious furniture, their rare wines,
and their ninepenny cigars disappear under the hammer of the
auctioneer.</p>
<p>Mr. Thistleton bought in everything.&nbsp; He bid with a
persistency and a viciousness that astonished the man in the
rostrum.&nbsp; When <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>the last article was knocked down to him, he turned upon
his late fellow-members, now dissolved and houseless, and with a
demoniac shout of derisive laughter cried, &ldquo;I am
avenged.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had grown a beard, and he had become
rich, two wonderful disguises.&nbsp; But there was no doubt about
it.&nbsp; It was the Sawdust Man.</p>
<h2><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>III.<br />
<i>LORD LUNDY&rsquo;S SNUFF-BOX</i>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Not</span> another farthing,
Tom.&nbsp; Not another farthing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But me no buts, Tom, as the man says in the
playbook.&nbsp; You have an ample allowance.&nbsp; I never object
to a hundred or two in advance to pay your club subscriptions, or
for any other legitimate purpose.&nbsp; But extravagance like
yours means vice, and vice I never <i>will</i>
encourage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Lundy shook his grey head at his son, heaved a sigh, felt
in the left-hand pocket of his vest, missed something, heaved
another sigh, and became absorbed in the Report with which he had
been engrossed when his son entered the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want a paltry two hundred,&rdquo; pleaded <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Tom, not by
any means willing to give up without a struggle.</p>
<p>His father once more looked up from his statistics, and
without altering his tone replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harkye, Tom.&nbsp; I have said my say.&nbsp; You know
the position which I hold as the patron of religious and
philanthropic societies.&nbsp; You are aware of the repute which
I bear.&nbsp; With your proceedings, and those of your
associates, rumour is busy.&nbsp; Such rumours reflect upon
me.&nbsp; Common decency should suggest to you that I am the last
person in the world to whom you should apply for fresh means
wherewith to procure fresh indulgence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, Tom.&nbsp; I am busy.&nbsp;
Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was useless to argue further.&nbsp; The Hon. Tom Foote,
with downcast countenance, withdrew; reflected that he must once
more have recourse to his friends, Shadrach, Mesech, and Abednego
in Throgmorton Street; and inwardly apostrophised his stern
parent as Old Father Adamant.</p>
<p>When Tom left the library Lord Lundy rang <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the
bell.&nbsp; When the menial entered his lordship was still
feeling in the left-hand pocket of his vest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, James,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell my man to look
for the snuff-box I usually carry.&nbsp; Must have dropped it
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James bowed and departed on his mission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tom, descending into Grosvenor Square, hailed a
passing hansom; but when the driver pulled up by the kerb he was
undecided in what direction to drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go to the Raleigh and consult Bruiser, or shall
I go direct to old Abednego, or shall I see Dot and explain
matters?&rdquo;&nbsp; This to himself.&nbsp; Then, suddenly
making up his mind to see Dot, he gave his cabman an address in
the vicinity of the Regent&rsquo;s Park, and abandoned himself to
his fate.</p>
<p>To his great delight, and, indeed, surprise, he found Dot in
the very best of tempers.&nbsp; Her little villa was surrounded
by a wall which protected it from the vulgar stare of the
passer-by, and Tom found her in her breakfast-room arranging
flowers and humming an air out of <i>Diana</i>, a burlesque which
she was at that time engaged in illustrating at the Mausoleum <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Theatre.&nbsp; She was arrayed in a morning-gown of
light-blue, trimmed with some fluffy stuff strangely suggestive
of powder-puffs.&nbsp; She received her guest with considerable
warmth; asked her &ldquo;poor old boy&rdquo; why he looked so
&ldquo;glum,&rdquo; and when in reply he admitted that he had
been unable to obtain the trifling sum which she had requested,
burst out laughing, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so solemn,
Dolly,&rdquo;&mdash;&rsquo;twas her pet name for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be able to do without it for the present.&nbsp; A
wealthy connection of mine has just died leaving me sufficient
for all immediate wants.&nbsp; And now what&rsquo;s the
news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom having mentally blessed the rich and opportune relative,
and having regretted aloud that any person should have deprived
him of the coveted opportunity of playing the part of relieving
officer, declared that there was no news.</p>
<p>He then began to look about the room.&nbsp; This is a habit
which most men have in visiting rooms where others, perchance,
may be received&mdash;others that they know not of.&nbsp; There
is a suspicion of the very furniture.&nbsp; A <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>jealousy of
articles left behind.&nbsp; Great Heavens! what heart-burnings
have been caused by the discovery of a strange cigar-case or a
ring with an unfamiliar monogram.</p>
<p>Tom, strolling up to the mantel-piece while chatting to Dot,
or listening to her artless prattle, perceived, nestling between
the ormolu timepiece and a vase of early primroses, a
snuff-box.&nbsp; He took it up and involuntarily
ejaculated,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot looked up, and observing the object of his curiosity,
exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, put that down, it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; said Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
snuff-box.&nbsp; Come, where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dot pouted.&nbsp; She must not be cross-examined.&nbsp; It was
an insult to her.&nbsp; Did Dolly doubt her?</p>
<p>But Dolly was in perfect temper.&nbsp; He declared himself as
devoid of doubt as a minor prophet, and having calmed the rising
emotions of the lady, said, with the greatest
<i>sang-froid</i>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me the snuff-box till to-morrow at this hour, and
I&rsquo;ll bring you the two hundred.&nbsp; Yes, and a fifty into
the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Only a loan, mind,&rdquo; stipulated the girl,
who, like most of her charming sex, had a mind irrevocably fixed
on the main chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;only a loan,&rdquo; replied the elated
Tom; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m going to turn
snuff-taker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Tom&rsquo;s logic or the hope of Tom&rsquo;s money
mollified Miss Dot, it is certain that when, an hour after, he
left Laburnum Villa, Regent&rsquo;s Park, N.W., he had the
snuff-box in his pocket.</p>
<p>It was from Lady Lundy that his lordship had imbibed his
religion and his philanthropy.&nbsp; She was, indeed, a
marvellous woman, and had been known on at least one occasion to
take the chair from which indisposition had driven her
husband.&nbsp; If ever a nobleman could have been said to be
hen-pecked, that devoted aristocrat was Lord Lundy.&nbsp; And
Tom, although more audacious in his expressions of defiance, also
stood in considerable awe of his mother.&nbsp; When on the
evening of the day during which all the events of this
unvarnished tale arrived, Tom sat down to dinner, both his father
and his mother were surprised at the flow of his animal spirits,
the redundancy of <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>his anecdotes, and the impudent way in which he
relegated to some future occasion all discussion concerning
Outcast London, or the heathen living in dark places of the
earth.</p>
<p>Being a Christian household, certain Christian customs were
observed in the Lundy establishment; so when Lady Lundy left the
room her husband and her son remained to discuss a glass of
claret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem in excellent spirits to-night, my boy,&rdquo;
said the father.&nbsp; And the remark was not uncalled for;
because when last father and son had met, the latter was
extremely downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, thank you,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to what may I attribute this change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken your advice, sir, and have commenced
to do something useful.&nbsp; I have gone into trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&nbsp; <i>Trade</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dealing in articles&mdash;if I may
call them so&mdash;of <i>virtue</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never more serious, I assure you.&nbsp; To prove it I
will sell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;A snuff-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The philanthropist laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is you who have been hiding my favourite
box.&nbsp; Hand it over this minute, you rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; this can&rsquo;t be <i>yours</i>.&nbsp; This is a
snuff-box with a history.&nbsp; It belonged, my dear father, to a
great philanthropist; and it was discovered in a breakfast-room
in the Regent&rsquo;s Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Tom exhibited the pretty receptacle,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you say for this highly authenticated
heirloom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two hundred you asked for this morning, Tom,&rdquo;
replied the father, with more coolness than might reasonably been
expected under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; said the son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred&mdash;five hundred!&rdquo; gasped the
philanthropist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say a thousand,&rdquo; insinuated Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be d&mdash;d if I do!&rdquo; replied the
philanthropist, with the utmost decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Tom, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
it to <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>her
ladyship, and see what she&rsquo;ll give me for it&mdash;and for
its story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, sit down, I command you.&nbsp; Not a word of
this.&nbsp; The money is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How Tom managed with Dot about retaining the snuff-box history
does not say.&nbsp; But it has been noticed with considerable
alarm that Tom has now a greater influence over Lord Lundy than
ever was obtained even by her ladyship.</p>

&ldquo;<i>ONE WAS RENT AND LEFT TO DIE</i>.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the traveller passes the City
of Oxford the Thames greatly changes its aspect.&nbsp; Locks are
deserted by their keepers.&nbsp; One has to open these waterways
for oneself, and there is usually a difficulty in finding the
bolts rust-eaten and honey-combed into a very corrugated species
of small-pox.&nbsp; For traffic has ceased a great way below, and
the gentle dwellers by the banks are a dull and slow race of men
given greatly to the consumption of beer.&nbsp; You may proceed
to great distances without seeing a human being.&nbsp; It is a
narrow Thames hereabouts and a shallow.&nbsp; Yet it is
infinitely pleasant in the early spring, when the birds sing
against each other in what to us appear songs of unaffected
gladness, but <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>which are really cries of baffled envy&mdash;of angry
jealousy.&nbsp; For even the note of the nightingale is now
relegated by the advance of knowledge to a place among our
shattered illusions.</p>
<p>Innocent lambs, sweetly unconscious of the rapidly growing
mint, bleat feebly at the unexpected apparition of a boat
containing a human being in flannels, and the great kine slaking
their thirst gaze with meek contemptuous eyes at the
intruder.&nbsp; How cool the rushes show standing by the
water&rsquo;s edge, unheeding as yet the earlier efforts of a sun
rehearsing for his summer effects.&nbsp; And above all, the deep
cerulean with its white clouds, motionless as those of the
painted canvas in the theatre&mdash;seeming more intensely white
as the black wings of the rook pass beneath with lazy sweep.</p>
<p>Twenty miles above Oxford&mdash;more than twenty or less than
twenty, for I do not wish the place identified&mdash;is the
village of &mdash;.&nbsp; It is situated about a mile and a half
from the banks of the Thames, and is a place which was at one
time of some consideration, but now is half asleep.&nbsp; It has
done its business and retired.&nbsp; Some wealthy men live in the
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>place and
its vicinity.&nbsp; The labourers look fat on a wage of a
shilling or so a day, and once a year there is a fair, which is
greatly deplored by the godly as calculated to undermine the
morals of the simple villagers, whom to my own knowledge stand in
need of no such temptation, being by nature somewhat prone to
forget that part of the moral law which inculcates advice
regarding the regulation of a man&rsquo;s desires.</p>
<p>The prettiest girl in &mdash; was Jessie Bracebridge.&nbsp;
She had long golden hair rigidly suppressed under her garden hat,
and soft blue eyes and a figure lithe but rounded.&nbsp; Her
dress was plain to a fault.&nbsp; For she was the only daughter
of William Bracebridge, cobbler and Methodist local preacher, a
pious enthusiast of great original power and extraordinary will;
but a pious enthusiast whose notions of Duty if carried out to
their fullest by mankind generally, would render the world a very
uncomfortable place to live in.&nbsp; In the year 1741 the Rev.
John Wesley had visited &mdash;, and, as appears from his
&ldquo;Journal,&rdquo; being greatly scandalised by the fact that
the Vicar hunted three days a week in the season, and that every
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>second
name inserted in the registry of birth was that of an
illegitimate infant, established a conventicle in the village and
set apart a local or lay preacher to look after his converts
until such time as he could send a regularly ordained minister to
supply their spiritual wants.&nbsp; The lay preacher was named
Bracebridge, and the Bracebridge whose name appears in this
unvarnished tale was grandson of the friend of John Wesley.&nbsp;
Bracebridge was indeed in a sort of Apostolical Succession.</p>
<p>In the glorious spring weather of 18&ndash;, Jessie
Bracebridge had wandered down to the river and stood among the
reeds looking across the great expanse of meadow beyond the other
shore, and wishing that her mother were alive again, and
wondering if people might be really good and relatively happy
without being so strict and stern as her father, or so instant as
he was in season and out of season.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, she was
indulging in day dreams of the great world outside, for she was
in her seventeenth year, and had read of the wonders of cities,
and, notwithstanding her father&rsquo;s denunciation of the
wickedness in them, longed perhaps to see and judge for
herself.&nbsp; Suddenly <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>her thoughts were diverted.&nbsp; A
lamb more silly than its companions&mdash;if indeed one lamb can
be more silly than another&mdash;had approached too near the edge
of the stream, and the bank giving way under its small weight it
fell into the stream and wakened the echoes with piteous
bleating.&nbsp; At that catastrophe Jessie shrieked aloud,
regarding the quadruped&rsquo;s as a life only less precious than
that of a human being.</p>
<p>A skiff came round the bend of the stream, and its occupant
was soon pulling toward the shrieking maiden.&nbsp; In her
distress she pointed to the drowning lamb, and he, not without
difficulty, rescued the woolly unfortunate, and then returned to
receive the thanks which he considered were his due&mdash;for
although we are all agreed that virtue is its own reward, few of
us are satisfied with that intangible recompense.&nbsp; He was a
frank-looking, bronzed, and brown-haired English youth, and she
blushed as, with the candid impulse of his nature, he expressed
his sorrow for her distress and his unfeigned delight that he had
been in a position to render a service which had given her
pleasure.</p>
<p>It was a short interview but it was a fatal <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>one.&nbsp;
She had looked and loved.&nbsp; He had looked and loved.&nbsp;
They met again.&nbsp; And again.&nbsp; And for the first time in
her life she had a secret from the father whom she feared.</p>
<p>But ah! for her what unthought of bliss in these
meetings.&nbsp; How she listened as her lover, her hero, talked
of the world of wealth and fashion&mdash;of the grand mansions of
London, of the historic colleges of Oxford.&nbsp; He sang to her
songs of the world, and even taught her, who heretofore regarded
as morally wrong anything in the way of a musical exercise not
contained in the compilation of John and Charles Wesley, to
warble such ditties.&nbsp; Of these it gave him a dreamy pleasure
to hear her sing to him a composition&mdash;which commenced or
ended&mdash;for I forget which&mdash;with the words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We threw two leaflets you and I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the river as it wandered on,<br />
One was rent and left to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The other floated onward all alone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An ominous quatrain.</p>
<p>Tom was the name of this sweet-voiced young lover.&nbsp; And
Tom was the son of an eminent judge, who has since exchanged the
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>ermine for
a crown of glory.&nbsp; Tom was at that time a student of
Magdalen College, Oxford.&nbsp; And Jessie, as you know, was the
daughter of a Methodist cobbler.&nbsp; Yet they loved all the
spring till he went away to the Continent and forgot all about
that pleasant spooning.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On the following spring Judge &mdash;, his revered parent,
went the Oxford Circuit.&nbsp; One day after the Court had risen,
he called at his son&rsquo;s chambers in Magdalen College.&nbsp;
There was an affectionate greeting between father and son, and
the latter, whom as we have seen, was a most impulsive and
kind-hearted young fellow, saw that his father was not looking
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look ill,&rdquo; he said, in his sweet musical
tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;The pestilential atmosphere of those infernal
courts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I have been engaged in trying a very sad
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom smiled incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of a judge of your experience affected by
anything that transpires in a Court of Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet so it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;The story must be an exceptionally terrible
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; It is only exceptionally sad.&nbsp; I will
tell it to you briefly.&nbsp; A young woman was charged with the
murder of her infant.&nbsp; The young woman was unmarried.&nbsp;
So far the story is unfortunately an ordinary one.&nbsp; She
refused to make any defence or divulge anything with regard to
the parentage of the child.&nbsp; A plea of not guilty was
entered, and I assigned counsel to defend her.&nbsp; But the
facts were too strong.&nbsp; The legal guilt of the unfortunate,
and, I may say, very beautiful victim was clearly established by
the witnesses for the Crown.&nbsp; But one witness appeared for
the defence, and he volunteered his evidence.&nbsp; He was a
tall, gaunt man, with a highly intelligent face.&nbsp; He was
dressed in broadcloth.&nbsp; He entered the box, and said, in
slow tones&mdash;the tones of a man suffering an unutterable
agony&mdash;&lsquo;My lord, I wish to speak to the character of
my daughter.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had no sooner spoken the words than
the prisoner uttered a shriek, which, to my dying day, I shall
remember.&nbsp; She shrieked the word &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; and
fell to the floor of the dock.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>There was great confusion in court
for some minutes.&nbsp; A medical man was sent for.&nbsp; When he
arrived he pronounced the prisoner dead.&nbsp; The prosecuting
counsel rose and announced the fact to the court.&nbsp; The
father still stood in the witness-box.&nbsp; His face was ghastly
pale, his hands clenched before him, his eyes were cast towards
the roof of the building and looked bright, as though he could
see through that obstacle to something above.&nbsp; Amid a dead
silence, in deep and infinitely pathetic tones he repeated the
words, &lsquo;The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, blessed
be the name of the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not ashamed to
tell you that tears fell on my note-book from these old eyes of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Tom,
casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Bracebridge, of &mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one moment a deadly paleness spread over the face of the
son.&nbsp; But in an instant he regained his self-possession, and
with his characteristic, frank, engaging manner, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old dad, no wonder the scene upset you.&nbsp; It
is, indeed, a sad story.&nbsp; Try a Laranaga, and let us talk of
something else.&rdquo;</p>

<i>THE GRIGSBY LIVING</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Grigsby</span> is in Kent, and although,
in respect of its hops and cherry-orchards, it is called upon to
pay extraordinary tithes, its inhabitants seem comfortable and
contented.&nbsp; An occasional agitator happening upon Grigsby
endeavours to arouse the farmers as to the iniquity of the
landowners.&nbsp; But these political missionaries receive but
scant welcome, and packing up their carpet-bags depart by early
trains.</p>
<p>Much of the neglect bestowed upon the disciples of those who
consider that land should be let at prairie rates may be traced
to the fact that for ten generations the Bodkins have been
established in the vicinity.&nbsp; And the present baronet, Sir
Lionel de Stacy <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Bodkin, is as popular with his tenants and with the
country-side generally, as anyone of his predecessors.&nbsp; The
Bodkins were good landlords and stuck by the farmers.&nbsp; And
the farmers, with a fine bucolic sentiment of reciprocity, stuck
by the Bodkins.</p>
<p>One of the Bodkins always went into the Church, and was
presented with the Grigsby living.&nbsp; Here he ministered to
the living Bodkins and delivered his sage platitudes to the
unheeding ears of the Bodkin effigies that lay in the chancel</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;staring right on<br />
With calm eternal eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenty-five years ago a curious break occurred in this
apostolic succession of Bodkins.&nbsp; Montagu being the
baronet&rsquo;s third son, and being, into the bargain,
&ldquo;the mildest-mannered man&rdquo; of whom it is possible to
form any adequate conception, had been destined for the Grigsby
living, and for the emoluments therefrom accruing, including
tithes ordinary and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Montagu had passed just a year at Christ Church, Oxford, when
his uncle, who <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>then had the living, died suddenly.&nbsp; And although
Montagu was not a man of very brilliant parts, he knew that by no
process of selection or patronage understood even by the Church,
could his ordination be so hurried as to permit of his stepping
into the shoes of his deceased uncle, and he further felt that
the inhabitants of Grigsby, being presumably possessed of
immortal souls&mdash;the said souls standing in weekly need of
saving&mdash;the living must be temporarily held by someone
outside the pale of the family.</p>
<p>During the first weeks following the death of the Rev.
Reginald de Stacy Bodkin, M.A., the subject was not broached in
the family.&nbsp; But when after a reasonable time grief had
become ameliorated, and nothing so demonstrative as a paroxysm
permissible, the son approached his father and observed, with his
peculiar drawl,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation is decidedly awkward and
complicated&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;not at all,&rdquo; replied the parent,
with decision.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s all
right.&nbsp; Go back to Oxford.&nbsp; By the time you&rsquo;re
ordained, Grigsby living will be ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Montagu
was still doubtful, and said hesitatingly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that I&rsquo;d better study for
the Bar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the general gloom, the baronet smiled as he
answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, when you are ordained I can present you
with a living.&nbsp; If you go to the Bar, I think it quite
unlikely that you will be able to pick one up.&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
Leave everything to me and go back to Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he left everything to his father and went back to
Oxford.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Five-and-twenty miles from Grigsby is Limpus-on-the-Wold,
which is, I believe, one of the very poorest parishes in all
England.&nbsp; It is not only poor, but it is wide-spread.&nbsp;
Its inhabitants are dense, and the work of its rector somewhat
wearing.&nbsp; At the time of this unvarnished tale the rector of
Limpus was Dr. Shotter, one of the most learned and pious
clergymen in the Church.&nbsp; But care, ill-health, anxiety, and
the death of his wife, had told on him.&nbsp; Moreover, he was an
old man.&nbsp; He had completed his seventieth year, <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and now
calmly waited an early call to the land of shadows, whither his
wife had preceded him.</p>
<p>Worn to a mere skeleton, with a small hectic spot burning on
his cheek and a hacking cough racking his frame, he sat at the
open casement inhaling the heavy perfumes of a hot July
afternoon.&nbsp; He was tended by his daughter, a staid woman of
forty, who placed her hand on his forehead when the fit of
coughing came, and handed him his draught, or spoke words of hope
and encouragement, when the old man gave it as his opinion that
the end was very near.</p>
<p>Then was heard the rattle of a heavy vehicle on the road, and
presently a drag and four steaming greys drew up before the door
of the rectory.&nbsp; A man of about fifty years of age descended
from the box seat, entered the rectory garden, and in a few
moments Dr. Shotter&rsquo;s daughter was reading from a card the
name of Sir Lionel de Stacy Bodkin, Bart.</p>
<p>The baronet was admitted, and by his fine, genial, hearty
manner soon found his way into the good graces of the rector.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;Badly-drained unhealthy hole this,&rdquo; he
remarked with candour, alluding not to the house in particular
but to Limpus generally.</p>
<p>The Doctor of Divinity nodded assent, and had a terrible fit
of coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get out of it, my dear sir.&nbsp; The place is
killing you.&nbsp; Limpus-on-the-Wold wants a young man with an
iron constitution.&nbsp; You are an old man, but with many years
of useful work before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Shotter shook his head and avowed that he had but little
interest in the life that now is, and made touching reference to
another and a better country, an allusion which caused his
daughter to weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; said the baronet; &ldquo;the beastly
vapours of this place have depressed you.&nbsp; Now, what would
you think of Grigsby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A paradise,&rdquo; sighed the old pastor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, enter that paradise.&nbsp; It is mine to
give.&nbsp; Genius like yours, sir, should be taken care of in
its old age.&nbsp; My dear madam,&rdquo; he continued, turning to
the daughter, &ldquo;add your solicitations to mine.&nbsp; There
is no hard work, there is the most charming air in Kent, and
there is a stipend which will permit the <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>purchase of
those luxuries to which an invalid is entitled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like a dream, sir; it seems too good to
believe,&rdquo; said the daughter.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she argued
with her father, and urged him till he was beaten down to a
solitary argument, which was that he was too weak to be moved
with safety.&nbsp; The kindly-hearted baronet, however, speedily
dispelled that difficulty.&nbsp; When the time came he would
arrange that the man of God should be removed by easy stages and
in the most comfortable of vehicles.</p>
<p>And that is the manner in which the Rev. Dionysius Shotter,
D.D., was appointed to the Grigsby living five-and-twenty years
ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Sir Lionel had praised the air of Grigsby he had not done
it more than justice.&nbsp; Compared with Limpus it was indeed a
paradise, and, to the great delight of his daughter Rachel, Dr.
Shotter lost his cough before he had been two months in the new
place.&nbsp; He began absolutely to put on flesh, found himself
capable of walking a mile without inconvenience, and displayed a
vigour in his pulpit discourses which would have roused <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>feelings of
envy, malice, hatred, and all un-charitableness in the breast of
his curate&mdash;had that divine been capable of such worldly
emotions.</p>
<p>If the prayers of a righteous man avail much, then should Sir
Lionel Bodkin have been one of the most blessed of mortals; for
the revivified minister prayed night and day for his benefactor,
and called frequently at Bodkin Towers to return his personal
thanks and to exhibit the beneficial results of the air of
Grigsby on a constitution which he had regarded as shattered
beyond hope of remedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, Rachel,&rdquo; he
observed, after one of these visits, &ldquo;but it seems to me
that Sir Lionel does not seem to exhibit much joy and
thankfulness at my marvellous recovery and daily access of
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fancy, pa dear,&rdquo; replied his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so.&nbsp; And yet, when I said to him to-day
that, next to Divine Providence, I owed my thanks to Sir Lionel
Bodkin, he replied, rather testily, I thought, &lsquo;Thank
Providence, my dear doctor, and not me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;It is only his brusque manner, dear; under a
rough exterior he hides the kindest heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so.&nbsp; It must be so,&rdquo; slowly
repeated the aged divine, in a tone which did not argue absolute
conviction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Montagu, at Christ Church, was zealously preparing
himself for the holy office to which he would soon be
called.&nbsp; And a year after the installation of the new rector
he received a letter which, neither in its subject-matter nor in
its tone, was one which a pious father should have despatched to
a boy about to become a light of the Establishment.&nbsp; The
letter read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Monty</span>,&mdash;My plans about the living have been all
upset.&nbsp; Before offering it to the present incumbent, I made
the most thorough inquiries of his medical man, and found that he
could not possibly live more than two or three years.&nbsp; In
fact, when I brought him down here he was little better than a
corpse&mdash;and a corpse with a daughter as old-looking as your
mother.&nbsp; But thanks to the change, the light duties, and the
damned <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>air
of Grigsby, the old doctor seems to have taken a new lease of
life, and, upon my soul, I see no reason in the world why he
shouldn&rsquo;t live to be a hundred.&nbsp; It is impossible for
me to explain to the old idiot the reasons why I placed him in
the position.&nbsp; Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe that even then
he would resign.&nbsp; I see no immediate chance of your having
the living.&nbsp; But, of course, he may die.&nbsp; At all
events, we must hope for the best.&mdash;Your affectionate
father,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;L. de S. B.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above letter was written twenty-four years ago.&nbsp; The
Rev. Montagu Bodkin is curate in a fashionable church in
London.&nbsp; He has grey hairs on his head now.&nbsp; He is
married to a sister of Lady Ashminton, and is greatly blessed
with progeny.&nbsp; The living which lies in the gift of the
Bodkin family, is still held by the Rev. Dionysius Shotter, D.D.,
a hale old man of ninety-five, who is never tired of singing the
praises of his lately deceased patron, or of extolling the
qualities of the air of Grigsby.</p>
<h2><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>VI.<br

<i>RES EST SACRA MISER</i>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> refuse absolutely to
give up the papers.&nbsp; You decline to comply with the order of
the Court.&nbsp; Then, sir, I shall commit you for
contempt.&nbsp; In prison you will have leisure in which to
reflect on the enormity of your conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word, sir.&nbsp; Your duty is to respect
the Court, not to argue with it.&nbsp; Officer, remove your
prisoner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And William Sadd was hurried away, placed in a fly, driven off
to Marston Castle, and handed over to the safe custody of the
governor of that establishment.&nbsp; The gates of Marston Castle
never closed on a prisoner more innocent of offence.</p>
<p>William Sadd was an inventor.&nbsp; His name <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>will be
chiefly known to the public in connection with a patent
corkscrew, but he had devised many other useful implements from
which he derived a comfortable income; for Sadd was a Scotchman,
and had carefully protected his rights against all persons
piratically inclined.&nbsp; He was born near Glasgow, where he
remained for some five-and-twenty years.&nbsp; Then, like many of
his countrymen, he came to England, and settled in the town of
&mdash;, a manufacturing community in the North.</p>
<p>He was a sanguine, good-tempered little man, and had married a
sanguine and good-tempered little wife, who bore him three
sanguine and good-tempered little boys.&nbsp; He had at one time
possessed a chum&mdash;another Scotch inventor.&nbsp; This man of
genius&mdash;McAllister by name&mdash;had died, leaving certain
papers to his friend as he lay on his death-bed.&nbsp; These
documents, chiefly relating to uncompleted inventions, he
confided to his friend with a last injunction that he should
under no circumstances surrender them, but complete and patent
them for the benefit of mankind and of his own pocket.&nbsp; Sadd
gave the <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>promise readily enough, feeling that nothing was more
unlikely than that the papers would be inquired after.&nbsp; Much
to his surprise, however, McAllister&rsquo;s executors, having by
some means heard of the existence of the documents, applied for
them as essential evidence in a case then in hand.&nbsp; Sadd
replied that they were not essential nor even relevant.&nbsp; His
assertion, however, availed him nothing.&nbsp; Finally, the judge
made an order for their production.&nbsp; Sadd calmly, but
determinedly, refused to comply with the mandate, and was
thereupon ordered to be confined in Marston Castle.</p>
<p>Although William Sadd felt acutely that it was an inconvenient
thing to be separated from his family even for one night, he was
sustained by the thought that he had done his duty, that he was
the victim of a misconception on the part of the learned judge,
and that his solicitor would, no doubt, set things right in the
morning.&nbsp; When, about an hour after his introduction to the
debtors and first-class misdemeanants occupying a common room in
the Castle, his solicitor visited him, he became quite indignant
with that luminary for suggesting <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that he should give up the
papers.&nbsp; He urged the man of law to have His Lordship
informed by the mouth of eminent counsel that the documents had
no earthly bearing on the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing&rsquo;s jest re-deeckless,&rdquo; said
the prisoner, absolutely smiling at the absurdity of the
judge&rsquo;s order.</p>
<p>His solicitor only shook his head and went away.</p>
<p>Among the other prisoners William Sadd became instantly
popular.&nbsp; He had the latest news from the outer world, and
as he was going to rejoin it on the morrow, he essayed to execute
all kinds of commissions for this brotherhood of
misfortune.&nbsp; His cheery conversation had aroused the
drooping spirits of those around him, when suddenly one and all
became depressed again.&nbsp; William, following the eyes of the
other victims, glanced towards the door, and, seeing a clergyman
enter, instinctively rose to his feet.&nbsp; His example was not
followed by any of the others, who turned sulkily away from
beholding the ecclesiastic.</p>
<p>The new arrival was the Rev. Joseph Thorns, <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Chaplain of
Marston Castle, and was familiarly alluded to by his congregation
as &ldquo;Holy Jo.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a man of small stature,
and was afflicted with a deformity between the shoulders, the
knowledge of which had permanently soured a temper not originally
angelic.&nbsp; He strode up to the latest arrival, who bowed
respectfully, and pulling out a note-book, asked
brusquely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner told him: but with the air of a man who regarded
the formality of taking it down in a book as an operation quite
superfluous, he being merely a lodger for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what have you been committed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ye ken,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sadd,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s jest a bit mistake.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
neglacted by my soleecitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Chaplain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Contempt
of Court,&rdquo; and he wrote that down opposite the
inventor&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; &ldquo;What religion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;m a member of the Auld Kirk,&rdquo; replied the
contemptuous prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought that even in the Auld
Kirk,&rdquo; said the clergyman, &ldquo;they would have taught
you to obey the law.&nbsp; Here is <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>a book for you,&rdquo; and he handed
him a copy of the hymn-book used in the chapel, turned sharply
round, and left the long, bare apartment, now looking longer and
more bare than ever in the eyes of the latest inmate.&nbsp; Sadd
soon, however, recovered his accustomed spirits, and eventually
became sufficiently composed to look through the hymnal.&nbsp; As
he by no means relished the chaplain&rsquo;s sneer at the Church
of his fathers, he observed somewhat maliciously to his
companions, holding up the book of sacred songs,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comparrit wi&rsquo; the Psawlms of David, they&rsquo;re
a wheen blithers,&rdquo; an observation which was heartily
applauded by the other misdemeanants as indirectly reflecting on
the parson.</p>
<p>The next day Mrs. Sadd appeared upon the scene, conveying a
basket of delicacies not included in the prison fare, and
conveying also the information that it would take some days
before the judge was in a temper to be addressed on the subject
of Sadd&rsquo;s contempt.&nbsp; When three days had passed, and
the judge was tackled by an eminent Queen&rsquo;s Counsel, he
absolutely refused to reconsider his sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the prisoner surrender the documents, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and then the
Court will consider whether or not he has purged the
contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus my lord on the Bench.</p>
<p>But Sadd was firm, and through his solicitor petitioned the
Home Secretary.&nbsp; The Home Secretary, having taken three
weeks to consider the matter, refused to interfere with the order
of the judge.</p>
<p>Then the spirits of the sanguine inventor fell suddenly to
zero.&nbsp; Nor were they manifestly revived by the daily visits
of his wife, for she, poor woman, with tears in her eyes, begged
and prayed her recalcitrant husband to give up the
documents.&nbsp; But even his love for her did not induce him to
forget his duty to the dead.</p>
<p>Sadd was committed to Marston Castle in the early part of
November.&nbsp; And before a month had passed over his head he
had become the most melancholy and morose of those resorting to
the common room.&nbsp; The others had some hope of release.&nbsp;
It seemed that he must remain there for ever, unless he
relinquished the sacred papers.&nbsp; His cheeks became sunken,
his shoulders bent, and his hair prematurely grey.&nbsp; He <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>sat apart
from his fellows and mumbled continually to himself.</p>
<p>It was during the first week in December that the others
thought he had gone mad.&nbsp; His &ldquo;little woman,&rdquo; as
he fondly called her, did not pay her customary visits.&nbsp; His
solicitor looked in and informed him that Mrs. Sadd was
dangerously ill in bed, and urgently pleaded this as an
additional reason for complying with the order of the
Court.&nbsp; Duty to the dead, love for the living&mdash;these
conflicting emotions tore his heart.&nbsp; In an agony of spirit
he motioned his solicitor to withdraw.&nbsp; Then he burst out
crying like a child, and never again opened his lips to mortal
man.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day there was service in the jail chapel.&nbsp;
Mr. Thorns preached an excellent sermon from the
text&mdash;&ldquo;The law is good if a man use it
lawfully.&rdquo;&nbsp; This exemplary cleric dwelt with great
severity on the evil that is in the world, and particularly on
the evil which brought men into jails.&nbsp; He then proceeded to
inform his attentive congregation of a fact which one would have
thought was painfully obvious to them&mdash;that punishment did
not fall only on the wrong <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>doer, but also upon those who were
near and dear to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Picture to yourselves,&rdquo;
went on the minister of the Gospel, &ldquo;picture your wives on
this holy anniversary, seated in silence and sadness, surrounded
by their weeping children.&nbsp; Think of their untold agony as
these innocent children&mdash;inheritors of a parent&rsquo;s
brand&mdash;put the tormenting question, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s
father?&rsquo;&nbsp; Picture&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It all happened in a moment; a prisoner had burst from the
benches occupied by the first-class misdemeanants; had scaled the
pulpit like a wild cat; had caught the chaplain by the throat;
had suddenly released his grasp; and, with a groan which those
who heard it will never forget, had fallen back on to the stone
pavement in front of the pulpit&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>When the body was searched the precious documents were found
stitched beneath his waistcoat.&nbsp; They disclosed an
unfinished scheme of the late Mr. McAllister&rsquo;s for so
dealing with horsehair as to render the wigs of judges not only
awful to the multitude, but comfortable to the wearer.</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>VII.<br />
<i>MR. GREY</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> five and twenty years, and on
every day during term time, Reginald Grey took his place on the
seats devoted to the Junior Bar in one of the Courts allotted to
Vice-Chancellors.&nbsp; He did not live to attend before
Vice-Chancellors in the spick-and-span mausoleum, that goes by
the name of the Royal Courts of Justice.&nbsp; When he was at the
Bar, the Vice-Chancellors sat in dingy buildings in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields&mdash;the same, indeed, which have
been so fully described in <i>Bleak House</i>.</p>
<p>To the reporters, barristers, general public, and to
successive Vice-Chancellors, Reginald was as well known as
&ldquo;the Fields&rdquo; themselves.&nbsp; He was a modest,
self-contained man, and he never held a brief.&nbsp; But he must
have known a wonderful deal of law, for he never <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>missed a
case, and he listened to every argument and suggestion as though
Coke <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i> were lecturing him
upon Littleton.&nbsp; Even when lunch time came Reginald did not
hurry out of Court with the chattering, surging crowd of
litigants and lawyers&rsquo; clerks.&nbsp; He sat quietly in the
position which he had taken up, and when the Court was quite
empty, drew a penny bun from his pocket, which he devoured,
gazing absently up at the roof of the Court.&nbsp; When the Court
resumed its duties, he brushed the crumbs from his trousers, and
when the Vice-Chancellor entered, he rose with the rest of the
Bar and bowed to his lordship with every dignity.</p>
<p>Wigs, gowns, and bands are, as articles of attire, subject to
the very same law of decay which affects a great-coat or a suit
of sables, and the years had not spared the robes which denoted
Mr. Grey&rsquo;s professional status.&nbsp; His wig was
discoloured by dust, smoke, and other accidents.&nbsp; Whole
wisps of horsehair stuck out here and there, and one of the
little tails which depend behind had fallen bodily away&mdash;had
perhaps been eaten away by rats.&nbsp; His bands were most
disreputable specimens of <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>man-millinery; for indeed he was his
own laundress, and washed those symbolic rags in his own basin,
drying them before his fire in his chambers in Gray&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; His stuff gown was a frayed and ragged garment; no
ragman would have advanced sixpence on it.&nbsp; For five and
twenty years had it&mdash;but there! it is about the man himself
I would speak.&nbsp; There is something to my mind so pathetic in
the sight of these forensic shreds and patches, that I cannot
bear to dwell on their dilapidation.</p>
<p>There was only one man in Court who took the slightest notice
of Mr. Grey: and he was a tall, florid, bustling, and&mdash;as he
once had a case of mine, I take the liberty of
adding&mdash;impudent gentleman, with an impressively loud and
boisterous manner.&nbsp; When he saw Grey even in his scarecrow
days he would sometimes throw him a hearty &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye
do, Grey?&rdquo;&mdash;but sometimes, I imagine, he pretended not
to see him.&nbsp; This counsel learned in the law was none other
than Mr. Stanley Overton.&nbsp; Grey took a great interest in
him, following him from court to court, and listening to him with
rapt attention as he <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>bullied his opponents and even the
Court; for a more vulgar, bullying, swaggering man than Overton
while he was at the Bar I never encountered.&nbsp; He toned down
greatly after his elevation.</p>
<p>As Grey grew from month to month more worn and shabby, so did
Overton become more sleek and resplendent.&nbsp; When once a man
commences in earnest there is no stopping him.&nbsp; The proverb
which tells us about the facility of the descent to Avernus is
only half a truth.&nbsp; The ascent to the stars is equally easy,
and is achieved every day both by the brave man and the
bully.&nbsp; It is as easy as the descent, and is a very great
deal more comfortable.</p>
<p>Some people were surprised when Overton was made a
Vice-Chancellor.&nbsp; In fact, the surprise was very
general.&nbsp; But it was not shared by Grey.&nbsp; That devoted
man thought it the most natural thing in the world.&nbsp; He
would not again have to follow this luminary in its erratic
circuit from court to court.&nbsp; His idol was now
enthroned.&nbsp; The worship would in future be offered in one
temple, and not in two or three.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>On the
morning when Overton took his seat as Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Grey
took <i>his</i> place in the back benches.&nbsp; And when the
newly-made judge entered, flushed with victory and imposing in
brand-new wig and robes, the whole Bar rose with great rustling
of stuff and silk.&nbsp; Grey rose too; and a solicitor&rsquo;s
clerk who sat next him saw his face turn ashen white, while two
great tears rolled down his emaciated cheeks; and when he sat
down he leaned his head on the ledge in front of him, covered his
eyes with his poor thin hand and sighed.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock that evening, when the Court rose to go,
Grey remained in that position till everyone had left.&nbsp; An
usher found him, and touched him on the elbow.&nbsp; He started,
looked about him on the emptiness in a dazed sort of way, and,
without saying a word, walked quietly off, the usher observing to
his plump assistant that Mr. Reginald Grey was &ldquo;a rum old
file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Grey&rsquo;s chambers were very, very high up in one of
the gaunt sets in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; Indeed, they were at
the top of the building&mdash;mere garrets.&nbsp; When he arrived
at them he <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>found his laundress arranging the tea things&mdash;he
seldom dined&mdash;and there was a decided odour of the savoury
kipper about the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mrs. Tracy,&rdquo; he said, assuming a thin
affectation of gaiety, &ldquo;this has been a great day for the
Inn&mdash;a great day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; assented that slipshod female.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;ve made a Vice-Chancellor of my old
friend, Stanley Overton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, sir.&nbsp; Which I&rsquo;m sure, I&rsquo;m
&rsquo;appy to &rsquo;ear it, an&rsquo; &rsquo;appy to &rsquo;ear
as he&rsquo;s a friend of <i>yours</i>, Mr. Grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very old friend indeed, Mrs. Tracy.&nbsp; Why, we
were boys together.&nbsp; We were at school together.&nbsp; We
were at college together.&nbsp; And we were both called to the
Bar the same day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Tracy.</p>
<p>Indeed, what <i>could</i> she say?&nbsp; Mr. Grey had always
been a remarkably reserved, reticent man&mdash;a &ldquo;little
queer,&rdquo; the good lady thought&mdash;and, beyond what was
necessary in the way of speech, quite silent and inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; went on the poor <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>barrister,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you something that will surprise you
even more.&nbsp; We were both in love with the same
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This indeed <i>did</i> surprise the draggle-tailed bed-maker,
and she looked her astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true; and the strange thing is that
she preferred me, or at least she told me so.&nbsp; And when I
left my home in Devonshire I was engaged to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Tracy did not now think that the gentleman was a
&ldquo;little queer&rdquo;&mdash;she was convinced that he was
stark staring mad.&nbsp; She looked apprehensively at the poor
thin knife that lay on the table.&nbsp; Reticent!&nbsp; Why, the
man was as garrulous and confidential as a village gossip.</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Overton was always a more pushing man, and a
cleverer man too; and after we were called he borrowed a hundred
pounds from me and went down to Devonshire.&nbsp; Some wicked
stories got circulated about my doings in London, in consequence
of which my sweetheart ceased to care for me, and Overton, who
was always a plucky fellow, ran away with her and married
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>His
voice trembled as he narrated that episode; but he returned to
the affectation of gaiety, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Tracy, and she&rsquo;s now Lady Overton; and
of course I&rsquo;m very glad of it, for her sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sir,&rdquo; acquiesces Mrs. Tracy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the funny thing is,&rdquo; he added, with the most
pitiable attempt at hilarity, &ldquo;he never paid me back that
hundred pounds&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a mockery of laughter, the cachinnation of a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-night, Mrs. Tracy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Devonshire, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>said</i> home,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but you
will come as usual in the morning, and see that all is
right.&nbsp; You can go, Mrs. Tracy.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the utter astonishment of the poor woman, he shook
hands with her, and, I fear, retained her hand for a moment, and
there was the suspicion of moisture in his eyes.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Mrs. Tracy came to see that all was
right, she found Mr. <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Reginald Grey stretched lifeless on
the hearthrug.&nbsp; A revolver lay beside him, and there was a
bullet through his forehead.&nbsp; In his left hand was an open
locket, containing a little wisp of straw-coloured hair.</p>

<i>THE PRODIGAL&rsquo;S RETURN</i>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Leave</span> my house!&rdquo;
shouted the Rev. Stanley Blewton to his son.&nbsp; Two
women&mdash;they were the Prodigal&rsquo;s mother and
sister&mdash;wept and pleaded.&nbsp; But the man of God was
inexorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;turning to his son&mdash;&ldquo;never
cross this threshold again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; retorted the reverend gentleman.</p>
<p>The face of his progeny burnt red, his eyes flashed, and he
clenched his fists.&nbsp; The women meanwhile redoubled their
sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, hold,&rdquo; added Mr. Blewton, as his son turned
to go.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall be treated beyond your
deserts.&nbsp; Here are ten pounds.&nbsp; Use them
discreetly.&nbsp; They are the last you will ever have from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;Keep your money, sir,&rdquo; answered Master
Henry Blewton&mdash;he was but seventeen years of age, and
inherited the hot temper of his parent., &ldquo;Mother,
good-bye.&nbsp; Maude, God bless you.&nbsp; I am
innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed his mother and sister.&nbsp; The flush of resentment
had died from his face.&nbsp; He turned to his father, and
extending his hand, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish me good-bye, sir.&nbsp; Time will set me
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But an ominous sneer played about the thin lips of the
clergyman.&nbsp; He pointed to the door, and his last words to
his son were,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have no parley with one who has brought
dishonour on my name.&nbsp; Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Blewton cast one longing look at his mother and sister,
and then walked straight into the hall, took his hat off the peg,
and, as the door closed on him, Mrs. Blewton screamed in her
agony, and fell into a faint that looked like death.</p>
<p>The Rev. Stanley Blewton was a man with a sense of honour
pushed to its extremest point.&nbsp; He had no forgiveness for
the sinner who brought discredit on an honest name.&nbsp; Like <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>all good
Christians, he was bound, I presume, to accept the story of the
thief on the cross.&nbsp; But as long as there remained another
text in the Bible he would never select that particular scripture
as the text of a discourse.&nbsp; His only son had through his
influence obtained a good appointment in a clerical insurance
office, in which the reverend gentleman was a shareholder.&nbsp;
He had been accused by his superiors of peculation.&nbsp; His
father&rsquo;s position, backing his remonstrances, kept the case
from coming into the police court.&nbsp; The matter was
&ldquo;squared,&rdquo; as the slang term has it.&nbsp; A public
scandal was averted.&nbsp; But certain persons at least would
know the secret.&nbsp; The Blewton name was smirched.&nbsp; This
his reverence would never forgive.</p>
<p>Henry walked with a rapid pace down Brixton Hill, for on that
reputable eminence his father&rsquo;s house was situated; passed
through Kennington, along the Westminster Bridge Road, crossed
the bridge, passed under the shadow of the clock tower, and went
up to a recruiting sergeant who stood at the corner of Parliament
Street.</p>
<p>During that walk the circumstances of Henry <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Blewton
underwent many important changes.&nbsp; To begin with, he had
changed his name, his age, and his occupation.&nbsp; He enlisted,
passed the doctor with credit, and blossomed eventually into
Private Nott of a valiant regiment of the line.</p>
<p>From that moment all trace of Henry Blewton became lost to his
friends and relatives, and for years they mourned for him as
people mourn for the dead.&nbsp; His concluding prophecy,
delivered with such meaning to his father, came true.&nbsp; Time
set him right.&nbsp; He had not been a year in the army before
the real delinquent was discovered; and, as the genuine sinner
had no influential acquaintances on the directorate of the
company, his case was remitted to the Old Bailey for the
consideration of a judge and jury.&nbsp; He was found guilty, and
sentenced to a term of imprisonment.&nbsp; Thus was the character
of Henry Blewton vindicated.</p>
<p>Useless, alas! now were the regrets and repentances of his
reverend father.&nbsp; Vain were the efforts of the private
detectives whom he engaged.&nbsp; The advertisements that he
caused to be inserted in the papers brought no <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>response,
and, after five years of fruitless labour and unavailing
self-reproach, his family came to the conclusion that he was
dead.&nbsp; He had perished from hunger, perhaps, or had hurried
himself into the presence of his Maker, goaded to distraction by
the paternal taunts.&nbsp; The reflection that his innocence had
been established ameliorated to some little extent the pangs of
mother and sister.&nbsp; But the very thought which gave them
consolation added to the poignancy of the father&rsquo;s
feelings.&nbsp; He mourned in secret, and cried with the man of
yore,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would to God I had died for him!&nbsp; My son, my
son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the very point where Brixton Rise merges into Brixton Hill
there is an avenue.&nbsp; It is a very well-kept avenue, and a
stately row of young trees runs along each side of it.&nbsp; A
notice-board informs the passers-by that there is &ldquo;No
Thoroughfare,&rdquo; and that this trimly-kept approach is
&ldquo;Private.&rdquo;&nbsp; On some fine days honest people are
beguiled by the spectacle of half-a-dozen men with cropped hair
and unbecoming uniform repairing the roadway.&nbsp; These
operators are directed by <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>another person.&nbsp; He is also in
uniform, and carries side arms and a musket&mdash;for the avenue
leads to Brixton Gaol, and the sullen road-menders are inmates of
that suburban retreat.&nbsp; It is perhaps within the knowledge
of the reader that military prisoners are now received in the
Brixton seminary; if not, the reader must take it from me that it
is so.</p>
<p>One wild November morning the gates of Brixton Gaol opened and
let loose a prisoner who had been confined for an assault on his
superior officer, that gallant captain having contributed
somewhat to the offence by dubbing the man a thief.&nbsp; He was
a fine, soldierly-looking young fellow of two-and-twenty, though
he looked much more.&nbsp; When he came to the end of the avenue
he found the chaplain waiting there, notwithstanding the
inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said the chaplain&mdash;a
kind-hearted Devonshire parson, who took more than the usual
perfunctory interest in his patients, as he was wont to call
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, sir,&rdquo; replied the soldier,
respectfully, and with an accent of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no money, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;Not a sou, your reverence,&rdquo; replied the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the chaplain, &ldquo;here are two
shillings.&nbsp; They will at least keep you for a day or
two.&nbsp; Seek work and keep honest.&nbsp; God bless
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven reward you!&rdquo; replied the man, writhing
under the kindness of the clergyman.&nbsp; The visitant to the
outer world did not move, however.&nbsp; He looked up and down
the hill, as if hesitating in what direction he should go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the parson, pointing down the hill,
&ldquo;that is the way to London&rdquo;&mdash;saying which he
turned up the avenue, and so re-entered the precincts of the
gaol.&nbsp; But the man did not take the direction indicated by
his benefactor.&nbsp; There was something in the atmosphere of
Brixton which seemed to agree with him.&nbsp; He found its
attractions more considerable than do most visitors to the noted
locality.&nbsp; He wandered in an aimless way up and down
by-streets.&nbsp; But the police&mdash;always solicitous about
the welfare of discharged prisoners&mdash;kept their eyes on
him.&nbsp; He had an uncomfortable feeling that he was being
watched.&nbsp; And he repeated with something of bitter irony <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>in his tone
the parting admonition of the chaplain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Seek work and keep honest!&rsquo;&nbsp; No easy
matter, Mr. Parson, with these sleuth-hounds on the
trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards evening he entered a small beer-house in the Cornwall
Road, a thoroughfare not far removed from the gaol.&nbsp; Here he
refreshed himself with bread and cheese and beer.&nbsp; Here also
he found company who did not object to his society, for it is a
comforting reflection that there are more wicked people outside
gaols than in them.&nbsp; And among these excellent fellows he
spent the time, until at the hour of twelve the landlord was
obliged to turn his customers into the bleak and blustrous
night.</p>
<p>The man bade good-bye to his companions, and sought the high
road.&nbsp; He proceeded up the hill with his back turned on
London.&nbsp; When he came to the substantial house of the Rev.
Stanley Blewton he stopped, looked up and down the road to see
that he was not followed, and then passed into the
clergyman&rsquo;s front garden, creeping forward under the shadow
of the bushes.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>At one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning the reverend occupant of the house
was wakened by a noise below; he listened, warned his wife to
keep quiet, drew on his trousers, took his revolver, and crept
downstairs in his naked feet.&nbsp; Yes, the thief had entered
the library.&nbsp; Mr. Blewton was, as we have seen, a person of
some determination.&nbsp; He opened the library door and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, or I&rsquo;ll fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But the voice was not allowed
to proceed.&nbsp; The sound indicated the position of the
robber.&nbsp; The minister fired two barrels in the direction of
the voice, and heard a body fall with a groan of&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;father&mdash;you&mdash;have&mdash;killed&mdash;me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was silence.&nbsp; Then another groan, and the fall
of another man.&nbsp; When the servants came with a light they
found the dead body of the father stretched by the dead body of
the son.</p>

<i>A PHILANTHROPIC</i> &ldquo;<i>MASHER</i>.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> elderly man with a pleasant
expression, iron-grey hair, and faultlessly dressed may
occasionally be seen walking along the shady side of St.
James&rsquo;s Street in the early afternoon.&nbsp; He gazes a
good deal under the bonnets of the pretty women.&nbsp; But there
is a demure and half-respectful expression in his glance which
withers any rising feeling of resentment.&nbsp; His age and his
unmistakably sympathetic half-smile give him an immunity which
would not be extended to younger and bolder men.&nbsp; He is
known to society as the Hon. Archibald Flodden.</p>
<p>Flodden is a member of three excellent clubs.&nbsp; His name
is on some extremely desirable <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>visiting lists.&nbsp; He goes to
church when in town every Sunday morning.&nbsp; His conduct in
public is most exemplary.&nbsp; And yet, somehow, Flodden has no
men friends.&nbsp; He has money, and therefore can always command
the society of a select circle of parasites.&nbsp; But men who
ought to be in his own set&mdash;or of whose set he ought to
be&mdash;do not care for his company.&nbsp; Nor do the female
leaders of society give him great countenance.&nbsp; He is not,
perhaps, regarded exactly as a <i>mauvais sujet</i>.&nbsp; But it
is generally admitted that there is something queer about
Flodden.</p>
<p>This sentiment was not, of course, inspired originally by the
fact that after two years of domestic infelicity his wife left
him, taking her infant daughter with her.&nbsp; Society naturally
took the man&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; The wife placed herself outside
the pale, and Flodden never asked her to re-enter it.&nbsp; He
took the matter philosophically, gave up his house in Sloane
Square, took chambers in the Albany, refused all communication
with his wife, and led the life of a sedate and philanthropic
bachelor.&nbsp; For eighteen years he has led this blameless and
almost idyllic life, and yet there exists in <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>society an
undefined distrust of him which is utterly unaccountable.</p>
<p>But though the great ladies of society, guided by an
infallible instinct, do not regard the Hon. Archie Flodden with
favour, there are certain other desirable persons who worship him
as the very <i>beau ideal</i> knight.&nbsp; These are ladies of
the middle-class, the wives of professional men, or the gushing
ornaments of suburban Bohemia.&nbsp; Their experience of
gentlemen is, perhaps, limited.&nbsp; They may be excused,
therefore, in mistaking Flodden&rsquo;s tinsel of politeness for
the gold of real gallantry.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising the number of interesting young persons
of the emotional and impressionable kind who have acquired a
sincere, romantic, but quite Platonic, regard for Mr.
Flodden.&nbsp; Happy chance has in the majority of instances
procured the introduction; and, as a rule, the male relatives of
the ladies are quite unaware of the discreet intimacy existing
between Flodden and their women-folk.&nbsp; Indeed, these male
relatives are all mere brutes, and it is part of Flodden&rsquo;s
edifying mission to sympathise with these dear <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>creatures, to
express distress that their sweetness should be wasted on such
clods of earth, and generally to insinuate comparisons between
himself and the lawful husband, which are infinitely detrimental
to the latter.</p>
<p>This hoary-headed squire of dames has the pleasantest possible
little five o&rsquo;clock teas at his chambers in the Albany, and
sometimes as many as eight, or even nine, of his young friends
will join him at that simple repast.&nbsp; Lord Roach
(&ldquo;Cock&rdquo; Roach he used to be called in his regiment),
who lives in the next set, seeing the ladies file out at
half-past six or so, has put it about that Flodden keeps a
dancing academy.&nbsp; But, though there is occasionally a little
piano playing, there has never been a dance; indeed, the
entertainment is chiefly conversational.&nbsp; Mr. Flodden never
used a rude or an improper expression.&nbsp; He has, however, a
wonderful knack of leading the conversation into doubtful
topics.&nbsp; The chaste annals of the Divorce Court afforded him
much agreeable food for comment.&nbsp; He would argue with some
of his impressionable admirers as to the possibility of a purely
Platonic affection, and at times he <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>would scribble off an epigram in
choice French on some living beauty, notorious for the number of
her amours.&nbsp; These trifles, written in a formal but
trembling hand, have found themselves in the private albums of
many an honest house in the suburbs.&nbsp; The ladies who were
the objects of his disinterested regard invariably alluded to him
as &ldquo;a dear, kind creature,&rdquo; the &ldquo;most
gentlemanly person,&rdquo; &ldquo;so sympathetic,&rdquo; and the
rest.&nbsp; The more gushing, recklessly declared him to be a
&ldquo;duck.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dean Swift, remembering his own
definition of the phrase, would have called him &ldquo;a nice
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hot afternoon in the July of last year, Mr. Flodden sat in
his luxurious chambers surrounded by half-a-dozen of his female
admirers, descanting on the superiority of French art as
illustrated by the examples which adorned his walls.&nbsp; Having
exhausted this topic, he proceeded to one more calculated to
stimulate the curiosity of his guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have got a little surprise for you, my dear ladies: a
fresh addition to our charmed, and may I say charming,
circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six fragile cups descended from twelve ruby <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>lips, and
twelve eyes opened wide with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a charming creature&mdash;so young, so beautiful,
so romantic, and so unfortunate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Six long-drawn
sighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Husband a cruel brute; absolutely beats her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twelve eyes cast in mute appeal to the heaven that exists
above Albany ceilings.&nbsp; Then the still, small voice of a
sympathetic inquirer&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you meet
this&mdash;this&mdash;paragon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret, my dear madam, an absolute and positive
secret.&nbsp; She was on her way to give lessons&mdash;she sings
divinely&mdash;in order to maintain her keeper in tobacco and
beer.&nbsp; Faugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six more long-drawn sighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she keep her appointment she will be here
directly.&nbsp; She is a shy, reserved little creature, but
should, I think, in such genial society thaw somewhat.&nbsp; Yes,
she really must thaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five minutes Flodden&rsquo;s man&mdash;a highly-respectable
person, well versed in his master&rsquo;s <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>little
ways&mdash;announced Mrs. Bird.&nbsp; This was the lady who had
so greatly fascinated the philanthropist, thereby driving six
sympathetic souls into paroxysms of jealousy.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that anything less reserved or shy than
Mrs. Bird had never before been presented to six neglected
matrons.&nbsp; Mrs. Bird was stylishly dressed, greatly made up,
and exhibited the undefinable <i>cachet</i> of the
professional.&nbsp; She called Mr. Flodden &ldquo;old
chappie,&rdquo; shook hands, unintroduced, with the assembled
tea-drinkers, hoped they were quite jolly, and then asked the
master of the establishment for a brandy and soda.&nbsp; That
worthy man of the world had turned red and white and even
blue.&nbsp; He was completely thunder-struck.&nbsp; It was
evident he must stop the compromising flow of her
conversation.&nbsp; The modest woman of his rambles had suddenly
become transformed into a something too terrible for
contemplation.&nbsp; A brilliant idea.&nbsp; He would ask her to
sing.&nbsp; Mrs. Bird was a woman of a most obliging
disposition.&nbsp; She sat down at the piano and dashed off a
showy prelude and commenced her song.&nbsp; You remember the
effect of <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Captain Shandon&rsquo;s tipsy ditty upon the good
Colonel Newcome; an effect somewhat similar was now produced on
the neglected wives.&nbsp; Mrs. Bird warbled out with unctuous
accent one of the most notorious ballads of a Parisian
<i>caf&eacute; chantant</i>.&nbsp; The matrons rose for shawls,
and the songstress, apprehending their intention, jumped from the
piano and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.&nbsp;
Flodden looked humiliated beyond measure; there was not a
pennyweight of philanthropy left in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;in
heaven&rsquo;s name who and what are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your daughter Gwendolyn,&rdquo; she hissed.</p>
<p>At that moment voices were heard from
without&mdash;Flodden&rsquo;s man shouting, &ldquo;You
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; and another voice consigning
Flodden&rsquo;s man to Hades.&nbsp; Then the door was thrust
open, and a cad in loud check trousers, a green-coloured
Newmarket coat, a white hat and innumerable rings, stood bowing
to the assembled company.&nbsp; He eventually fixed a somewhat
bloodshot eye on the philanthropist and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, my festive fossil, when next <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>you go a
followin&rsquo; other men&rsquo;s wives, you see as they
ain&rsquo;t your own daughters!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the Great
O&rsquo;Daniel, the star comique.&nbsp; Gwen&rsquo;s my wife,
an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re my pa-in-lor.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a horder;
give us a turn and bring your lady friends with you.&nbsp; My new
song, &lsquo;The Elderly Masher,&rsquo; is no end of a go.&nbsp;
Come along, Gwen.&nbsp; Good-bye, par.&nbsp; Ladies, bong
joor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he tucked Gwendolyn under his arm, bowed, and left
the apartment.&nbsp; The other guests retired in solemn silence,
wiser, and, let us hope better, women.</p>
<p>And that was Mr. Flodden&rsquo;s last five o&rsquo;clock tea
at the Albany.</p>

<i>A DISHONOURED BILL</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bill itself, considering the
prospects of the acceptor, was not for a very alarming
amount.&nbsp; He was heir to a baronetcy and &pound;50,000 per
annum.&nbsp; The bill was for &ldquo;a monkey&rdquo;&mdash;or, in
more intelligible phraseology than that usually adopted by the
acceptor himself, for the sum of five hundred pounds
sterling.&nbsp; The extraordinary circumstance about the bill was
that the acceptor, Harry Jermyn, paid Abednego, of Throgmorton
Street, interest at the rate of sixty per cent. per annum for the
accommodation, and that in addition he had to take part of the
proceeds in the shape of a park hack, which he found difficulty
in selling to a cab proprietor for a five-pound note.&nbsp; The
consideration deducted from the bill in respect of this animal
was fifty pounds.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Harry
Jermyn was a <i>mauvais sujet</i>; that is to say, he was a young
gentleman kept by his father on a short allowance.&nbsp; He
gambled a little, went to all the races, was a member of the
Raleigh and other social centres of a similar kind, and evinced a
considerable interest in the drama&mdash;that is to say, at
theatres where the sacred lamp was kept burning.&nbsp; In fact,
he resembled hundreds of other young men of our acquaintance; and
probably he would not have been called a <i>mauvais sujet</i>
were it not that the old baronet restricted him to means
inadequate to supply his simple desires.</p>
<p>Mr. Abednego was not a <i>mauvais sujet</i>.&nbsp; He was a
most respectable man; had a house in Mayfair, another in
Richmond, and a mansion in Scotland which he modestly called his
shooting box.&nbsp; He occasionally entertained live lords, who
borrowed his money and sneered at him behind his back.&nbsp; He
had contrived to obtain a seat on a county bench, and was a
Colonel of Volunteers in the same happy county, by reason of
which he was known to society at large as Colonel Abednego.</p>
<p>When Harry Jermyn&rsquo;s bill fell due he <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>rushed down
in a hansom to Abednego&rsquo;s office in Throgmorton Street, and
was&mdash;after an ominous delay&mdash;admitted to the sanctum of
the great Abednego himself.&nbsp; That potentate did not rise,
but nodded quickly to his visitor, with a short, and by no means
encouraging, &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry was a man with a fine flow of animal spirits, and was
not to be dashed by the studied coolness of his reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, old chappie,&rdquo; he replied, with the
greatest good humour, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; Feel
a little chippy this morning? or lost a point or two at sixpenny
whist last night&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jermyn, this is the City,&rdquo; said the
money-lender.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is, old boy,&rdquo; answered Jermyn,
sitting on the edge of the table opposite the financier,
&ldquo;that damn bill of mine falls due to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course you&rsquo;ll renew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo;
answered Abednego, rising and taking out his watch.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Harry&rsquo;s jaw fell considerably.&nbsp; His former
experience of this exemplary man had not prepared him for
this.&nbsp; It had only prepared him for the incurring of fresh
interest and the possession of park hacks anything <i>but</i>
fresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, old man, I <i>must</i> have the coin,
don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Jermyn considered this sort of argument
unanswerable.&nbsp; His host resumed his seat, and looking the
young man in the face, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I found her expensive myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
surprised that <i>you</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry jumped from his seat on the table, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;What in Hades do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Baby Somerville of the Frivolity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; shouted the borrower, &ldquo;she
is my wife.&nbsp; I have married her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; quietly answered Mr. Abednego.</p>
<p>Of course a blow followed.&nbsp; When Abednego had pulled
himself together, and wiped the blood from his face, he said, in
tones now quivering with rage,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young scoundrel, you shall suffer for
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>That
was the end of the interview.&nbsp; Jermyn withdrew at once,
wrathful and defeated, and next day the bill for &ldquo;a
monkey&rdquo; was dishonoured.</p>
<p>Now, strange as it may appear, Harry Jermyn had really married
Baby Somerville of the Frivolity, a shapely, vain, and heartless
woman, incapable of an affection, except perhaps for some brute
of a chorus man.&nbsp; There was a period in her career, however,
when she was considered <i>chic</i> by a certain number of men
about town.&nbsp; Jermyn unfortunately allowed his passion to
take an honourable direction.&nbsp; He wanted to have her all to
himself; and she, knowing him to be heir to a baronetcy, without
any conventional coyness consented to be his wife.&nbsp; But at
the time of his marriage, and until he heard it on the day before
his bill was dishonoured, he had no suspicion that Abednego had
been among the admirers of his wife; and when he taxed her with
it, she denied the fact with such accent of sincerity that he
clasped her to his heart and called her by a hundred endearing
names.&nbsp; He was, you see, an indubitable <i>mauvais
sujet</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Mr. and
Mrs. Jermyn were spending the early days of their married life on
the upper Thames, where, to her credit be it said, the lady
affected a pretty interest in waving corn, and floating lily
leaves, and shrilling larks, and other beauties which, I am told,
abound in the neighbourhood of that incomparable stream; and, on
the Sunday following the unpleasant interview with the magnate of
Throgmorton Street, Mr. Jermyn was sculling his young bride in
the skiff which he had purchased for her, and called after her
name.</p>
<p>It was a glorious July day, and the river was crowded with
craft of every description.</p>
<p>The lock at &mdash; was open and half full when they reached
it.&nbsp; Jermyn took his skiff gently in, and held on to the
side of a launch, the deck of which was crowded with laughing
women and men in gorgeous array.&nbsp; In the cabin a lunch was
laid, and cases of champagne reposed pleasantly in the
stern.&nbsp; Jermyn cursed his indiscretion a moment after, when
he discovered that a number of the sirens on deck were members of
the Frivolity chorus.&nbsp; But the worst was to come.&nbsp;
Abednego, flashing <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>with diamonds, exquisitely raddled as to his cheeks,
stood at the tiller, and addressing Mrs. Jermyn, said, with an
air of easy familiarity,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Baby, how are you gettin&rsquo; on,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was bad enough, but when Harry turned sharply round on
his wife, he saw her big eyes turned longingly on the resplendent
Hebrew, and her smile cast boldly on his painted
countenance.&nbsp; At that moment the devil entered into
Jermyn&rsquo;s soul as surely as ever it took possession of the
Gadarene swine.&nbsp; His lips turned blue, his face was livid;
but he made no other sign.&nbsp; His was the last boat to leave
the lock.&nbsp; He rowed steadily on, and never spoke to the
woman he had loved so well and so unwisely.</p>
<p>Mr. Abednego had enjoyed a real good time on board the launch,
and on his way down stopped at the famous riparian village of
&mdash;.&nbsp; Here also Jermyn landed some time after.&nbsp; He
sent his wife home by train, and put up at the same hotel as that
occupied by his opulent rival.</p>
<p>No one ever knew how it happened.&nbsp; Close <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>to the
village there is a lock, and by the lock is what is called a
hook&mdash;a horseshoe of water running round from a point above
it, and, after making a vast circuit, emerging at a point
below.&nbsp; For the most part this hook is shallow, but in
places it is deep as the wells described by Herodotus.&nbsp; At
six o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, Abednego, who was
fond of the water, repaired to a remote part of the hook.&nbsp;
Five minutes after Harry Jermyn also proceeded to the bathing
place.&nbsp; He must, however, have selected a spot out of sight
of the &ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; for that gentleman was
unfortunately drowned without Jermyn&rsquo;s even having seen
him.&nbsp; A certain mark was discovered round Abednego&rsquo;s
throat, but the coroner very sagely informed the jury that with
that they had nothing to do&mdash;it might be a mark of
long-standing.&nbsp; Mr. Jermyn volunteered evidence as to having
seen nobody in the vicinity of the hook.&nbsp; Verdict in
accordance with such evidence as was
produced&mdash;&ldquo;Accidental death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months afterwards the famous case of Jermyn <i>v.</i>
Jermyn, Smith, Jones, and Another was heard, which, as the public
will recollect, <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>resulted in a verdict for the husband, who is now a
prematurely aged and curiously reticent man&mdash;the inheritor
of a baronetcy and fifty thousand pounds a year.</p>
<h2><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>XI.<br

<i>A MAN OF GENIUS</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Felix Carter</span> was always on the look
out for unappreciated genius, the which, when discovered, he
would clothe, feed, and house until the time came&mdash;as it
invariably did come&mdash;when he found out that the gold was
tinsel.&nbsp; He never for one moment suspected that he himself
was the happy possessor of that divine endowment which he so
reverenced in others.&nbsp; And yet his friends all swore that if
any man ever were gifted with genius, Felix Carter was that
individual.&nbsp; He was a sort of artistic Admirable
Crichton.&nbsp; He painted exquisite pictures.&nbsp; He had
written three novels.&nbsp; Plays of his had been produced with
success.&nbsp; And he played the violin like a very
Paganini.&nbsp; Acquaintances spoke of him as being
eccentric.&nbsp; <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>But every man is accounted eccentric whose talents cover
a wide area and whose heart is abnormally large.</p>
<p>Play writing, novel spinning, and violin practice Felix
regarded as recreations.&nbsp; His real profession was that of an
artist.&nbsp; And his big bachelor establishment in a North
Western suburb of London will be remembered as the scene of some
brilliant receptions, at not a few of which Carter&rsquo;s latest
Man of Genius would put in an appearance, to the great surprise
of guests, who very properly refused to see any merit whatever in
his utterances.&nbsp; Sometimes three or four undesirable
pensioners would be quartered on the establishment.&nbsp; And
although Carter&rsquo;s friends deplored the circumstance, not
one of them dare remonstrate.&nbsp; He was the victim of
perpetual disappointment in his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>,
but would resent any interference with his practical
philanthropy.</p>
<p>One of Carter&rsquo;s Men of Genius lived with him and on him
for a period of more than six months.&nbsp; It was amusing always
to hear his enthusiasm over this big, blotchy-faced loafer.&nbsp;
He bored all his friends by a description of his <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>first meeting
him, of his desire to see him again, and of the happy coincidence
of their second encounter.&nbsp; Carter was greatly given to
prowling about unknown London for the purpose of picking up
&ldquo;effects.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew the opium-smoking
quarter.&nbsp; He had been in a thieves&rsquo; kitchen, and he
knew his way to the most disreputable common lodging-houses in
the metropolis.&nbsp; He occasionally dropped in at the
&ldquo;White Elephant,&rdquo; a public-house situated in a slum
off Fleet Street, where every night in the week a discussion took
place on the events of the day.&nbsp; This discussion was carried
on in a hall at the back of the &ldquo;White Elephant,&rdquo; and
was mainly contributed to by subsidized speakers whose feats of
oratory were intended to encourage the ambitious vestryman who
smoked his pipe there, or the occasional young barrister who
dropped in upon his way to or from the Temple.&nbsp; But the
audience generally was made up of solicitors&rsquo; clerks,
solicitors who had been struck off the Rolls, with here and there
a fiery disciple of Bradlaugh from the unsavoury fastnesses of
Clerkenwell.&nbsp; It was in this resort that Carter first saw
and admired Joseph Addison, the <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>large and very loathsome person who
eventually shared his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;Joseph is the
most wonderful chap.&nbsp; By Jove, sir, you should have heard
the way he pegged into those Radicals.&nbsp; He made them
squirm.&nbsp; I wish old Gladstone had been there to hear him,
upon my soul I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it happened that late one night Felix
encountered his paragon lying asleep under a bench in St.
James&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; It is more than probable that the
creature was drunk after a day of successful sponging.&nbsp; But
his admirer only saw a man full of gifts and faculties suffering
from cold and hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gad, old boy,&rdquo; he said in describing the
scene, &ldquo;I could have cried to see a man, who could talk Sir
William Harcourt&rsquo;s head off, perishing for want of a penny
roll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Addison was treated as reverently as if he had been his
great namesake, was made free of Carter&rsquo;s house, was
introduced to his studio friends, and was generally rendered a
great deal more comfortable than he deserved to be.&nbsp; His
appearance was sadly against him.&nbsp; His eyes were shifty and
blood-shot; his bushy <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>black whiskers were never submitted
to the torture of the comb; his finger nails were invariably
dirty, and his expression was that of effrontery struggling with
awkwardness.&nbsp; His clothes of seedy black vainly endeavouring
to conceal an unwashed shirt seemed as if they had been
persistently slept in, and his eyeglass depending from a white
string completed the picture of a rakish adventurer.</p>
<p>It is true that these deficiences of attire were gradually
ameliorated, and Joseph Addison appeared in the linen and jackets
of our friend, to which, however, this hopeless and abominable
ale-house ornament managed to impart a debauched and dissipated
air.&nbsp; Of this Carter saw nothing.&nbsp; Nor did he consider
it extraordinary that the unsightly incubus should drink his
brandy at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, or that he should
smoke his Latakia out of his favourite pipes.&nbsp; All these
little familiarities he set down as being so many eccentricities
of genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bottle of brandy to me if it makes
Joseph talk!&nbsp; I tell you I have heard that man emit epigrams
by the hour.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a little shy before
strangers.&nbsp; But you should <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>hear him when we&rsquo;re
alone.&nbsp; By the lord Harry, Rochfoucauld isn&rsquo;t in it
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Felix Carter, a man of taste, refinement, culture, and
genius, worshipped this idol of mud, this tavern sponge, this
bar-soiled, gin-soddened impostor.&nbsp; So Titania was enamoured
of an ass.</p>
<p>Although it was perfectly true that Joseph Addison never
ventured on any epigrams before Carter&rsquo;s friends, he
committed some of them to writing, for the benefit of
posterity.&nbsp; These wonderful sentiments Addison&rsquo;s hand
had traced with charcoal on the white-washed walls of the studio,
and Carter would point them out with genuine enthusiasm as though
they were</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;jewels
five words long<br />
That on the stretched forefinger of all time<br />
Sparkle for ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respect and love for Carter induced his associates to affect a
great belief in the value of these jewels of thought scrawled on
the walls in the most vulgar hand imaginable.&nbsp; That there
may be no doubt as to the literary and philosophical value of the
gems, I will reproduce them here.&nbsp; On one wall&mdash;just <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>where
Carter could see it as he painted, was inscribed the
legend&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">God Loves the
Worker</span>.</p>
<p>Opposite the entrance to the studio appeared in characters of
greater magnitude the intimation&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Labour is
Prayer</span>.</p>
<p>While above the mantel-piece, between two beautiful
&ldquo;studies&rdquo; from the nude, ran the
inscription&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Labor Omnia
Vincit</span>.</p>
<p>As the Latinity of this recondite quotation was impeccable, I
presume that Mr. Addison had extracted it from Bartlett&rsquo;s
Dictionary of Quotations.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the large heart and simple faith of the
artist, one would have been inclined to see nothing in the unholy
alliance but its ludicrous side.&nbsp; But knowing how firm was
the faith of the victim in his new discovery, there was a dash of
pathos in it which checked laughter.</p>
<p>Many attempts were made to expose the fraud.&nbsp; Secret
meetings of the admirers of Carter met in adjoining
studios.&nbsp; All sorts of <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>conspiracies were set on foot.&nbsp;
Most ingenious devices were proposed and unanimously
adopted.&nbsp; But they were unavailing.&nbsp; All were
frustrated by the unsuspicious nature of Carter, or by the low
cunning of the beer-swilling brute who was living in easy
idleness on his money.&nbsp; It is generally believed that at
this period certain of the younger and more enthusiastic
followers of Carter had set on foot a plot for the extermination
of Addison, and that his early assassination was by some deemed
feasible and desirable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Carter on one
occasion to the most plain-spoken of his friends,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out why all you fellows fail to see that
Addison is a Man of Genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may the reason be?&rdquo; asked Plain
Speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all jealous of his
ability&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to say
&lsquo;Bah,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Carter, waxing enthusiastic as he
invariably did on this theme, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s impossible to
explain your dislike on any other theory.&nbsp; Joseph is worth a
dozen of the fellows who <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>make money by literature in these
days.&nbsp; I have written books myself, and ought to know
something about it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find him out one of these
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will you,&rdquo; was Plain Speaker&rsquo;s
response.</p>
<p>Herein Plain Speaker indulged in unconscious prophecy.&nbsp;
That which friendly conspirators could not bring about was
contrived by the omnipotent finger of Fate.</p>
<p>Felix Carter went to the Isle of Wight to execute a commission
for an invalid magnate in that pleasant settlement, and as he was
anxious that a trustworthy and gentlemanly person should take
charge of his house during his absence, he left his friend and
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, Joseph Addison, in that responsible
position.&nbsp; The artist had been about a week at work when he
came upon the following gratifying item in one of the London
papers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;POLICE
INTELLIGENCE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bow Street</span>.&nbsp; A <span
class="smcap">Thief</span>.&mdash;<i>Joseph Addison</i> alias
<i>Ward</i>, alias <i>Peters</i>, 40, was charged before Mr.
Flowers with stealing from the waiting-room of the Charing Cross
Station a black bag containing jewellery, the property of M.
Laurent of Paris.&nbsp; On the prisoner were found a gold <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>watch, an
opera-glass, a silver fruit-knife, and a valuable
cigar-case.&nbsp; These articles bear the initials &lsquo;F.
C.&rsquo;&nbsp; The prisoner was remanded for further
inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My initials!&rdquo; sighed Carter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend will now get plenty of that labour which he
affects to love,&rdquo; said Plain Speaker.</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>XII.<br />
<i>A DIGNIFIED DIPSOMANIAC</i>.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A <span class="GutSmall">MOST</span> remarkable man,
sir,&rdquo; said the Secretary of the Teetotal Union to the
President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t he strike you as being a trifle&mdash;a
trifle soiled, eh?&rdquo; asked the President, glancing down at
his own immaculate shirt-cuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; replied the Secretary,
hesitatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a most dignified
man&mdash;most dignified.&nbsp; An&rsquo; in his dress shoot most
impressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really, now, Mr. Bottle, I thought, d&rsquo;ye
know, that he rather smelt of beer.&nbsp; Just a little,
eh?&rdquo; suggested the President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beer!&rdquo; echoed the Secretary, in a tone of mingled
astonishment and indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beer!&nbsp; Why, sir,
he&rsquo;s one of the most <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>ardent spirits engaged in the
teetotal cause.&nbsp; He has been one of us for upwards of ten
years or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And before that, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was on the Press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; observed the President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s quite reformed <i>now</i>,&rdquo;
answered the Secretary, to the objection implied in the
President&rsquo;s monosyllable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say he is really eloquent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so&mdash;<i>very</i>, remarkably so.&nbsp;
In fact, I may say a puffick J. B. Gough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he written in favour of the cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Largely, sir.&nbsp; His tracks is well
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then send him in again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject of this conversation&mdash;which took place in the
Committee Room of the Teetotal Union, in Aldersgate Street,
City&mdash;stood in an outer chamber, gravely
contemplative.&nbsp; All that Mr. Bottle, the Secretary, had
urged in favour of his dignified demeanour, was quite justified
by his appearance.&nbsp; But the reflections of Alderman Lamb,
the President, were also to a great extent borne out by what
little of him was visible to the naked eye.&nbsp; Indeed, the
remarkable man was a <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>trifle more than soiled.&nbsp; He
was very dirty.&nbsp; He might be described as an old-young
man.&nbsp; He had curly grey hair, thin and rather distinguished
features, a small nervous hand, an imperturbable solemnity of
expression, and a dignity of pose worthy the immortal Mr.
Turveydrop.</p>
<p>At the bidding of the Secretary, he re-entered the sanctum of
the President, to whom he bowed low and impressively.&nbsp; He
sat in the chair offered to him, and looked at Mr. Lamb as though
he would have said to that worthy Alderman and Spectacle Maker,
&ldquo;Will you have your case disposed of now, or do you wish it
sent to the Assizes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Mr. Bottle,&rdquo; began the President, as Mr.
Browley, the remarkable man, bowed condescendingly to that
functionary, &ldquo;our Mr. Bottle suggests that you should
temporarily fill the place of one of our regular lecturers.&nbsp;
A lecture is announced for to-morrow night at the Temperance
Hall, New Cut.&nbsp; The remuneration is small&mdash;two pounds,
in fact.&nbsp; Will you accept the offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Browley, in solemn tones,
&ldquo;you honour me.&nbsp; I accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;<i>I</i>,&rdquo; went on the Alderman,
&ldquo;will be in the chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm me with honours,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Browley, with another obeisance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;the
title of your lecture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, sir.&nbsp; Indeed, you have a right to
know.&nbsp; I call it an Oration.&nbsp; It is entitled,
&lsquo;The Demon Drink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital, capital,&rdquo; said the Alderman, rubbing his
hands as if relishing the idea of being made personally
acquainted with the Demon in question; &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t
forget the hour&mdash;eight o&rsquo;clock at the Temperance
Hall.&nbsp; Good-bye, Mr. Browley; glad to have made your
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Browley made no motion of withdrawal.&nbsp; With a
slight movement of the right hand he signalled that he was about
to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there is a slight
preliminary.&nbsp; I have made it a rule in dealing with
religious and philanthropic societies always to extort a small
sum in advance as a pledge of good faith.&nbsp; I am not in any
want of money, nor do I doubt your ability and willingness to pay
it.&nbsp; But <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>I have made it a rule, and I invariably insist on
compliance with it.&nbsp; If you will pay me half a
sovereign&mdash;not necessarily for publication, but as a
guarantee of good faith&mdash;I will accept that
amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear sir.&nbsp; Mr. Bottle, pray let the
gentleman have ten shillings, or a sovereign if he wants
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said <i>half</i> a sovereign,&rdquo; said the
lecturer, impressively.</p>
<p>That sum was handed to him by Mr. Bottle, who took his
receipt, and Mr. Browley appeared once more in the outer air.</p>
<p>For a remarkable man with a great interest in the temperance
cause, it must be admitted that his first two visits were
somewhat singular in their nature.&nbsp; His first visit was to a
pawnbroker&rsquo;s, where he redeemed a dress suit pledged for
three shillings, and his next visit was to a public-house, where
he called for a pint of bitter and Burton&mdash;in a pewter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s both meat and drink,&rdquo; he murmured,
as he licked his lips.&nbsp; It was evident that the remarkable
man spoke from conviction, for he hardly passed a tavern on his
way from town to the remoter slums of Islington <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>without
eating and drinking after the same fashion&mdash;with this slight
variation, that at the last half-dozen houses of call he
substituted for the beer that decoction which Mr. Eccles alludes
to as &ldquo;cool, refreshing gin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reeled at last into his own street, and staggered into the
one room occupied by himself and his wife.&nbsp; He threw the
bundle of dress clothes on the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maggie! get me that &lsquo;Demon Drink.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to deliver the &lsquo;Demon&rsquo;
to-morrow.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, John, remember what the doctor said at the
hospital.&nbsp; All excitement is so bad for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the doctors.&nbsp; Produce the
&lsquo;Demon,&rsquo; d&rsquo;ye hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so alternately damning the doctors and demanding the
Demon, he sank on the bed and snored the snore of the
drunk.&nbsp; She knelt by his side and wept, and&mdash;God help
her!&mdash;prayed.&nbsp; She remembered him, you see, when he
returned from College with his University honours thick upon him,
and before the Demon had got him&mdash;tight.</p>
<p>There was a great audience the next night <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>at the New
Cut Hall, and Mr. Browley, in his dress clothes, looked somewhat
more presentable than on the previous day.&nbsp; His wife had
managed to procure linen, and the worthy Alderman in the chair
was quite pleased and encouraged by the improved appearance of
the lecturer; though it is true he once whispered to Mr. Bottle
that he thought he detected a very strong smell of drink in the
room.</p>
<p>Mr. Browley was in due course presented to the large and
highly expectant audience.&nbsp; And it must be admitted that
rarely had an audience the opportunity of listening to an oration
of such force and vigour.&nbsp; The whole figure of the lecturer
seemed to change, his face glowed, the assumption of
<i>hauteur</i> left him as he assailed the drink Demon and
portrayed his victims.&nbsp; Now a torrent of applause followed
some well-aimed hit at the vendors of drink, and now some
pathetic anecdote drew tears from the eyes of his auditors.&nbsp;
The Alderman was enchanted, and applauded vociferously; now
agreeing with his secretary, that Mr. Browley was indeed a very
remarkable man.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Presently the lecturer proceeded to deal with the awful
disease which turns the habitual drunkard into a dangerous
maniac.&nbsp; He described the progress and effect of <i>delirium
tremens</i>.&nbsp; His eyes now flashed wildly as he portrayed to
the affrighted audience devils from the pit of hell; and goblin
forms and pursuing shapes of beast and reptile.&nbsp; His body
swayed to and fro: he spoke in gasps; his mouth seemed parched
and hot.&nbsp; Now his eye-balls appeared to shoot from his head,
and his arms were moved in front of him as if to ward off the
creatures of his fancies.&nbsp; The effect was electrical.&nbsp;
The audience rose at him, and followed his effort with
long-continued applause.</p>
<p>In the middle of it all the lecturer&rsquo;s face appeared to
grow livid, his eyes fixed, and his limbs stiff.&nbsp; He placed
his left hand to his temple, and with his stretched forefinger
pointed in front of him.&nbsp; Then he moaned as a wild animal
moans in pain, and fell backward on the platform.&nbsp; A wild
shriek burst from the back of the hall as his wife rushed
forward, jumped upon the platform, and threw herself on the
prostrate body.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>A
doctor arrived in due course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bottle, when he had examined
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Dead!&rdquo; answered the physician.</p>

&ldquo;<i>OLD BOOTS</i>.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> five years ago, on days when
the sun shone warmly, an old man might have been observed taking
the air in Kennington Park.&nbsp; He was one of those seedy and
aimless old gentlemen usually described as having seen better
days.&nbsp; He was generally supposed to have been engaged in the
City in early life, and to live upon a small pension tendered to
him out of the generosity of his old employers.&nbsp; He lived in
humble apartments in a street which ran off the Camberwell New
Road, and he attended twice on Sundays the conventicle of a
strict sect of Dissenters, by whose minister he was much
respected, although his small means prevented his subscribing
liberally to the chapel funds.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>In
Kennington Park he was treated with less respect&mdash;the
geniuses of that famous resort having christened him &ldquo;Old
Boots,&rdquo; in friendly recognition of the very disreputable
manner in which he was shod, and the fact that his boots were
never subjected to the necessary operations of the blacking
brush.</p>
<p>Accompanying him in his walks was his only daughter, a maiden
of nineteen or twenty years&mdash;a sparkling brunette, who, by
her talent as an amateur milliner, was enabled out of very poor
materials to dress herself becomingly and even with taste.&nbsp;
She appeared quite devoted to the old gentleman, and many who saw
them at once admired her for her filial affection, and also
deplored the fact that a young woman so elegant and amiable
should have her chances of matrimony spoiled by the caprice of an
old man.</p>
<p>For, although Mr. Lowndes&mdash;that was the old
gentleman&rsquo;s name&mdash;attended his religious duties with
great regularity, he was shy of making acquaintances, and
reticent with a few whom chance had forced upon his
society.&nbsp; And this by such people of the world as vegetate
in Camberwell was put down to his <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>selfishness.&nbsp; He was unwilling,
they said, to give his daughter a chance of marrying, not because
his love for her was great, but because he did not wish to lose
so invaluable a nurse.</p>
<p>In this they did &ldquo;Old Boots&rdquo; a grievous wrong, for
he loved Jessie better than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>Among the very few whose acquaintance the Lowndes family had
made was a Mr. Evelyn Jones, a clerk in a bank in the City.&nbsp;
This exemplary young gentleman belonged to the same conventicle
as Mr. Lowndes, was a teacher in the Sunday-school, and bade fair
to become a bright and shining light in the City.&nbsp; But these
circumstances would not in themselves have led to a
friendship.&nbsp; The fact is that he lodged in the same house as
the superannuated City man and his daughter, and was in the habit
of purchasing out of his own small means certain delicacies which
the old man was too poor to provide.&nbsp; Evelyn was a frank,
unsuspicious youth, and was permitted sometimes to join his
fellow-lodgers for half-an-hour of an evening, when it was quite
apparent that his pleasure was contributed to <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>rather by
the presence of Jessie than by the highly-improving conversation
of her parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you think a man could afford to marry
on?&rdquo; he asked, during one of these visits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; replied Mr. Lowndes, &ldquo;on the
man; but more especially upon the woman.&nbsp; But why do you
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve got a rise of ten pounds
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, may I ask,&rdquo; went on the old man,
&ldquo;does that make your salary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety pounds a-year,&rdquo; replied Evelyn, with a
flush of honest pride.</p>
<p>The old man smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough to keep a house on&mdash;a very
<i>small</i> house, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how much <i>would</i> be enough?&rdquo; queried the
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any young couple should commence
housekeeping on less than a thousand a-year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn looked in blank amazement at his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand a-year!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;That was the amount I mentioned,&rdquo; replied
the old gentleman, with some asperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall never make such an income,&rdquo; he said,
in great despondency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should never get married,&rdquo; added the
philosopher, calmly.&nbsp; Feeling, however, that he had been a
little too harsh in his manner, he went on,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must not despair.&nbsp; Much money is made in
the City by honesty and application.&nbsp; Be industrious, my
young friend, and be honest.&nbsp; Heaven has rewarded other City
men for the illustration of these qualities; Heaven may reward
you.&nbsp; And now good evening.&nbsp; Jessie and I have some
private business to transact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jones was dreadfully cast down by this interview.&nbsp;
Because, truth to tell, he had fallen in love with the patient
and beautiful lady who attended so assiduously on her broken-down
father.&nbsp; And he had thus artfully contrived to obtain from
the old gentleman a general opinion on the subject of
matrimony.&nbsp; The result of his investigations was that he
came to regard Mr. Lowndes as a perfect monster of
selfishness.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;He guessed at what I was driving,&rdquo; said
Evelyn to himself, when he gained his own room.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
suspects that I want to marry Jessie, and has put a thousand
a-year upon her as his price for making the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Evelyn Jones had been bred in the country, and had
imbibed certain old-fashioned notions on the matter of courtship
from his parents.&nbsp; He would have considered it a
dishonourable act on his part to approach Jessie with an offer of
marriage without having first consulted her only surviving
parent.&nbsp; He inferred from a hundred little signs that she
was not indifferent to him.&nbsp; But his highly moral training
prevented his taking advantage of these circumstances to press
his suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she had a mother,&rdquo; he sighed;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d soon talk her over.&nbsp; And to hear that
selfish old paragon talking of a thousand pounds!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll be bound he never had so much money in his whole
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Depressed spirits are but temporary afflictions with the young
and sanguine.&nbsp; What appears at first to be an overmastering
despair clears off.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope springs eternal&rdquo; in
the lover&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; And in a week&rsquo;s time Evelyn
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Jones
had recovered his equanimity, and determined once more to address
&ldquo;Old Boots&rdquo; on the subject nearest to his
heart.&nbsp; He purchased a pound of grapes and a bottle of port,
and having returned to the suburban delights of his apartments
off the Camberwell New Road, he watched the door of his
fellow-lodger until he saw Miss Lowndes disappear to the lower
regions to consult with her landlady.</p>
<p>This was his opportunity.&nbsp; He knocked at the door of Mr.
Lowndes, and was bidden in short and querulous tones to
enter.&nbsp; He presented his gifts to the old man, who, under
the circumstances, could not do less than request him to
remain.&nbsp; The port was opened&mdash;and so was the
conversation.&nbsp; At first it meandered lightly among
generalities.&nbsp; But eventually the young man &ldquo;plucked
up a spirit,&rdquo; as the phrase hath it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember, Mr. Lowndes, my talking to you on
the subject of matrimony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered the other, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> am in love.&nbsp; <i>I</i> want to
marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say again, that on ninety pounds a-year it would
be idiotcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted the ardent Jones, &ldquo;she is
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>so good,
such a clever housekeeper that I think she could make ninety
pounds a-year go very far indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who, may I ask, is this paragon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Lowndes, forgive me&mdash;pity me.&nbsp;
I love your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones, in all the scenes which his lively imagination had
conjured up as likely to follow his proposal, did not imagine
that which really occurred.&nbsp; Lowndes jumped from his chair;
he became erect, his eyes flashed as he cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel!&nbsp; You fool!&nbsp; Have you breathed
word of this to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, upon my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Boots&rdquo; sank back into his chair, apparently
much relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, menacingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tomorrow I will leave this.&nbsp; Do not attempt to follow
us.&nbsp; The consequences be on your own head if you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the door of the sitting-room opened, and two
men entered, followed by Jessie, pale and alarmed.</p>
<p>One of the men spoke,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morton,&rdquo; he observed, quietly, &ldquo;we have
tracked you at last.&nbsp; You are arrested for <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the robbery
of ten thousand pounds from the British Bullion Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Boots&rdquo; stood before them erect and even
dignified.&nbsp; Jessie flew to him, and throwing her arms round
his neck, wept bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, the peccant
secretary of the Bullion Bank.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I request you to
show some consideration for this innocent lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn Jones stood forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir, do not shrink from knowing you in
your&mdash;your misfortune.&nbsp; I will take care of your
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brainless puppy!&rdquo; shrieked the
prisoner.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>She is my wife</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so indeed she was.</p>

<i>A MISSING HEIRESS</i>.</h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">RECENT</span> case of a Missing
Heiress&mdash;how recent does not matter&mdash;attracted a large
amount of public attention.&nbsp; Stimulating paragraphs first
suggested that an heiress <i>was</i> missing.&nbsp; And
eventually still more stimulating paragraphs announced that she
had been found&mdash;and found under circumstances the most
romantic in the world.&nbsp; If the mothers of Missing Heiresses
deposit their little charges on strange doorsteps and at an early
age, it is no reasonable matter of surprise that difficulty
should arise in satisfactorily tracing them.&nbsp; And the
heroine of the case under consideration will have the
satisfaction of knowing that had it not been for the untiring and
disinterested efforts of the heir-at-law, she must <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>have
continued to perform menial duties to the end of time.&nbsp; The
Missing Heiress having been suddenly transformed into a
Discovered Heroine, did not thereupon cease to be an object of
public interest.&nbsp; Indeed the interest increased.&nbsp;
Editors of penny dreadfuls set their young men to &ldquo;work
up&rdquo; exciting fictions on the basis of facts, and a
sensational evening paper discussed the circumstances in a
leading article full of that learning, good taste, and common
sense, for which the organ in question has been for so long and
so justly celebrated.&nbsp; The righteous example of the
sensational broadsheet has been followed with more or less
success by the editors of the provincial papers, and the story of
the Missing Heiress has become as familiar in our mouths as
&ldquo;household words.&rdquo;&nbsp; But while Society and its
organs have been discussing the romantic history of the Heiress
from the area, neither Society nor its journals have so much as
heard of the story of Mrs. Stubbs, the wife of the umbrella-maker
of Blandy Street, Manchester.&nbsp; And there is nothing more
certain in the world than this: that had there been no Missing
Heiress there <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>would have been no story to tell of the wife of the
umbrella-maker of Blandy Street, Manchester.</p>
<p>When the good fairy of that romance of real life to which we
have alluded determined to assure himself of the existence of the
Missing Heiress, he went to considerable expense in advertising,
in consulting lawyers, in having conferences with detectives, and
the like.&nbsp; And it was quite surprising to find how many
Missing Heiresses turned up to tell the story of how they had
been left upon a certain night on a certain doorstep.&nbsp;
Stubbs first heard of the affair from the landlady of the
&ldquo;Six Bells,&rdquo; and he immediately came to the
conclusion that Mrs. Stubbs was the lady in question.&nbsp; Mrs.
Stubbs was a foundling.&nbsp; Mrs. Stubbs had been found on a
doorstep.&nbsp; Mrs. Stubbs had been found on a doorstep in the
very identical town where the Missing Heiress had been
deposited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It tuk my brothe away,&rdquo; said Stubbs, in
afterwards describing his sensations.</p>
<p>Stubbs was a small and secretive umbrella-maker, and kept the
news to himself until he had seen a man of law.&nbsp; But though
Stubbs <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>kept the news to himself he was unable to disguise its
effects.&nbsp; If the truth must be told, Stubbs was a
short-tempered, tyrannical man, habitually cruel and contemptuous
to the wife of his bosom.&nbsp; She had for a short time after
marriage attempted to assert her position and maintain her
individuality.</p>
<p>But Stubbs being a Republican and a Freethinker, stood upon
his undoubted rights, reduced his wife to what he described as
her &ldquo;proper spear,&rdquo; and became thenceforward and for
ever &ldquo;mawster in his hown &rsquo;ouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he
himself explained to the President of the Republican
Circle&mdash;an influential society holding weekly meetings at
the &ldquo;Six Bells,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said as &rsquo;ow I&rsquo;d break her, an&rsquo;
she&rsquo;s broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the same evening that brought to Mr. Stubbs the
intelligence concerning the Missing Heiress, Mrs. Stubbs was in a
great distress of mind because she was behindhand with her
husband&rsquo;s tea.&nbsp; A domestic failure of this kind was
always calculated to arouse the dormant eloquence of her
lord.&nbsp; Indeed, a very trivial shortcoming on the part of
Mrs. Stubbs was <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>apt to bring down on her devoted head hard words and
sometimes, I regret to say, hard blows.&nbsp; In her efforts to
expedite matters on this particular evening, Mrs. Stubbs&mdash;as
is occasionally the case&mdash;instead of forwarding domestic
affairs had delayed them.&nbsp; And when the door suddenly
opened, and her irate lord stood on the threshold, <i>she</i>
stood in the midst of a &ldquo;confusion worse
confounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; With trembling accents, and not daring
to lift her eyes, she faltered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;m a bit late, John,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her intense surprise, John replied in tones more faltering
and deferential than her own,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s orright, Mary, dear.&nbsp; Better late than
never, don&rsquo;t ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He calls me &lsquo;dear,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mary to
herself, lifting her eyes to ascertain whether her husband was
sober.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; He was evidently under no alcoholic
influence.&nbsp; And yet there he stood, blushing, stammering,
and holding in his hand the hat which heretofore in his own house
he invariably carried on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly, and
blushing more than ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve
been a bit inattentive to you, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>As
Mary had never had to complain of his want of attention she very
wisely replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I &rsquo;<i>ave</i>,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;and
you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; pale like.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s git our
tea over an&rsquo; go to a theayter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surprise of Mrs. Stubbs blossomed into a wild and
astounded amazement.&nbsp; She looked straight at Mr. Stubbs to
see whether he was in earnest, and coming to the conclusion that
sincerity was defined there, she deliberately went up to her
husband and kissed him.&nbsp; He submitted to the infliction with
a good grace, though still blushing consumedly.&nbsp; The play
was to Mrs. Stubbs the height of earthly bliss.&nbsp; She was a
person of small intellect and simple tastes, and followed with
childlike wonder the moving histories illustrated on the
stage.&nbsp; It mattered not to her whether the play was comedy
or tragedy; burlesque or melodrama.&nbsp; There were colour and
ornament and music.&nbsp; These sufficed.&nbsp; And from the rise
of the curtain till its fall she watched the proceedings
open-mouthed and wondering.&nbsp; That her husband should not
only permit her to enjoy her favourite amusement, but absolutely
<a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>offer
himself to accompany her to the theatre overwhelmed her, and so
in the first moment of surprise she had kissed him.</p>
<p>His conduct all through the evening was delightful.&nbsp; He
comported himself like a very squire of dames; purchased for her
ginger-beer and oranges, and reminded her, as she coyly
suggested, of the happy days of their courtship.&nbsp; His
conduct then was but a foretaste of his conduct for many days to
come.&nbsp; He discovered that Mary was overworked, and insisted
on having a girl in to assist her in the house.&nbsp; Every
moment, when not employed in his small shop&mdash;it was little
better than a stall&mdash;he spent in his house, usually
appearing with a votive offering in the shape of a lobster or a
basket of mushrooms, or even a box of chocolate creams.&nbsp;
Except on &ldquo;meeting evenings,&rdquo; he never now entered
the &ldquo;Six Bells,&rdquo; but spent the precious hours at home
like a devoted husband, smoking his pipe, sipping gin and water,
and reading for her such extracts from the daily broadsheets as
contained no allusion direct or remote to Missing Heiresses.</p>
<p>The lawyer who had been consulted by <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Mr. Stubbs
was like his client, a Member of the Republican Circle.&nbsp;
Also, like his client, he was a Socialist and Freethinker; and
his name was Chatham.&nbsp; From the first instruction given him
by Mr Stubbs, he expressed the greatest confidence in the claim
of his wife, and prosecuted his inquiries with the utmost zeal
and goodwill.&nbsp; Mr. Stubbs had at the time of his important
discovery a hundred pounds in the bank.&nbsp; The most of this
money soon found its way into the office of Mr. Chatham.&nbsp;
Inquiries of the kind cost something.&nbsp; There are so many
journeys to be made, so many witnesses to be interviewed; so many
reams of foolscap to be crossed, all at the rate of so much per
folio.&nbsp; But Mr. Stubbs, strong in the belief that his wife
would soon be worth untold gold grudged none of it.&nbsp; Indeed,
when it was all gone, he borrowed other sums.&nbsp; It was, after
all, only the proverbial sprat to catch the proverbial
whale.&nbsp; The blubber would repay him when realised.&nbsp;
Until everything was made clear, however, he preferred to keep
his wife in the dark.&nbsp; And the interval&mdash;it could only
be a short one&mdash;he magnanimously devoted to cultivating the
<a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>acquaintance of a helpmeet whom he had long
neglected.</p>
<p>When the hundred pounds had all gone, and when the obliging
persons who had lent him sums of money to &ldquo;go on
with,&rdquo; became clamorous for repayment, he had his moments
of depression.&nbsp; He was, however, sustained by the assurance
of his lawyer, and consoled by the unremitting attention of his
wife.&nbsp; At times when the fit of melancholy was particularly
bad, he would break into some exclamation such as in less happy
days he had used to Mrs. Stubbs.&nbsp; But he immediately checked
himself, and called her his &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;guiding star.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she, poor woman, accepted
the amendment, soothed and comforted her ruffled consort, and
expressed a belief that his monetary troubles would soon be
over.</p>
<p>Her prophecy was verified.&nbsp; His monetary troubles
<i>were</i> soon over.&nbsp; Once again Mrs. Stubbs was expecting
her husband&rsquo;s return to tea.&nbsp; But there was no
confusion now.&nbsp; The table was laid, the kettle boiling, the
bread and butter cut, and the shrimps and water-cresses gracing
the festive board.&nbsp; The master <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>of the house was late.&nbsp; But he
would soon return, no doubt bearing a peace-offering&mdash;now
invariably delivered to his spouse when he failed to be
punctual.&nbsp; She was thus reflecting when the door burst
suddenly open, and John Stubbs entered with his hat on his
head.&nbsp; His face was pale, his eyes seemed to start from his
head.&nbsp; He approached the table, struck it with his closed
fist and&mdash;I regret to have to record it&mdash;called his
wife &ldquo;a she devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was one of the dear old
words of an earlier and more tempestuous period.&nbsp; She bore
it in silence.&nbsp; But when he yelled,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s found, you swindler!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear,
y&rsquo;imposter, the real Heiress is found, ye deceitful
hussy,&rdquo; she was puzzled beyond measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my money?&rdquo; he howled, as he pulled
the cloth from the table and dashed the shrimps and water-cresses
to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hundred
pounds.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the money I spent in bonnets
an&rsquo; in theayters an&rsquo; in chocolate creams?&nbsp; Eh,
you thing!&nbsp; <i>You</i> born on a doorstep!&nbsp;
Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then proceeded to demolish the furniture, and his wife
displaying that discretion which <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>is the better part of valour,
watched her opportunity, and when his back was turned fled out
into the street.&nbsp; She believed that he was mad.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was&mdash;for he managed that night to fall into the
river and die there.&nbsp; After the inquest the members of the
Republican Circle, with whom he was deservedly popular, gave him
a semi-public funeral with banners and music.&nbsp; Towards the
cost of the obsequies Mr. Chatham contributed a guinea.&nbsp; And
to this day Mrs. Stubbs, who is doing very well in the laundry
line of business, has never been able to guess the cause of her
deceased husband&rsquo;s insanity.</p>

135</span>XV.<br />
<i>TEDDY MARTIN&rsquo;S BRIEF</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Martin</span> occupied chambers in
Lime Court, Temple.&nbsp; His rooms were situated on the first
floor, and from his front window the visitor could command an
uninterrupted view of the sun-dial over the way, upon which was
inscribed one of those useful moral legends which in earlier
times our rude forefathers were accustomed to carve upon such
slabs as marked the flight of time.&nbsp; Those who trod the
well-worn flags of Lime Court would sometimes hear the tinkling
of a piano welling out over the geraniums in those front windows,
and sometimes the piano would tinkle an accompaniment to snatches
of opera-bouffe sung by a showy but somewhat unsympathetic female
voice.&nbsp; Barristers&rsquo; clerks passing beneath and hearing
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>this
harmony would wink knowingly at each other, and interchange
opinions regarding the Martin <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.</p>
<p>All the world knows of Martin&rsquo;s celebrated
&ldquo;Crystal Ale&rdquo; at nine shillings the nine-gallon
cask.&nbsp; Teddy Martin was the son of the maker of that famous
brew.&nbsp; It will be, therefore, inferred that the young man
was not quite so dependent on the support of solicitors as other
members of his Inn.&nbsp; Indeed, his allowance was so large as
to make him the envy of many brilliant but impecunious members of
the Junior Bar, who hated him for his prosperity, and grudged him
the briefs which at long intervals were confided to his care.</p>
<p>Like many other young gentlemen of taste and fortune, Teddy
Martin was a persistent supporter of the British Drama.&nbsp; He
was quite catholic in his tastes.&nbsp; Irving was not too dull
for him; nor was the Gaiety too fast.&nbsp; If, indeed, the truth
must be told, he preferred those theatres at which burlesque
entertainment formed the staple fare; and even found amusement in
the festive society of those vestals whose agreeable mission it
is to keep burning the sacred lamp of burlesque.&nbsp; He <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>formed
acquaintance with the ladies of the chorus.&nbsp; A member of the
Junior Bar, he cultivated the society of members of the Junior
Stage.</p>
<p>It was the voice of one of these sirens which woke the echoes
in Lime Court after the shadows had fallen and the lamp had been
lit in the court below, and which scandalised Mr. Solon, Q.C.,
struggling with a brief of several hundred folios in the chambers
beneath.</p>
<p>Martin has never inquired into my domestic secrets, and I have
no wish to inquire into Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Topsy Varden, it is
true, left the stage shortly after she had become acquainted with
Mr. Martin; had appeared in his chambers, and had taken
possession of his piano.&nbsp; I have met her there, but know no
more than the porter whether she resided in Lime Court <i>en
permanence</i> or whether she only visited Mr. Martin, for whom
she seemed to have a great partiality.&nbsp; Perhaps she came
early in the morning and returned late at night to her mother in
Camden Town.</p>
<p>At that time I was writing dramatic notices for the <i>Slough
of Despond</i>&mdash;a Society organ&mdash;<a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>and was,
when I visited Teddy&rsquo;s chambers, the subject of a vast
amount of agreeable wheedling on the part of Miss Varden, who
assured me that she never would be happy off the
stage&mdash;<i>that</i> she wouldn&rsquo;t; that she knew of my
influence with Jones of the Royal Bandbox, and with Robinson of
the Royal Potentates&rsquo; Theatres, and that if I didn&rsquo;t
get her a &ldquo;shop&rdquo; at one of the houses in question I
was a wretch&mdash;<i>that</i> I was.&nbsp; In fact, she talked
of nothing else; didn&rsquo;t appear to know anything that was
going on in the world, and never read any newspaper except the
<i>Mummers&rsquo; Mouthpiece</i>.</p>
<p>One morning I called on Teddy Martin, and found him at
breakfast.&nbsp; Topsy had arrived very early that morning,
apparently, for she was at breakfast with her admirer, and had
done him the compliment to come in a white morning gown, with
wonderful arrangements in lace at the throat and wrists.&nbsp; I
found the ingenuous Martin in high glee over a brief for the
prosecution in a case in which he was to appear that day at the
Old Bailey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my boy,&rdquo; he exclaimed; <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great case.&nbsp; And if only my
learned leader <i>would</i> absent himself, I&rsquo;d give them a
taste of my quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had nothing better to do, and consented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take <i>me</i> too,&rdquo; said Miss Topsy, with an
admirable affectation of piteous imploring.&nbsp; It was bad
enough for Topsy to visit at his chambers, but he was not likely
to run the risk of flaunting her gay presence in the temple of
justice herself.&nbsp; He put her off with a kind word,
adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be here when we return; we&rsquo;ll
all go to dinner at Verrey&rsquo;s, have a box at the theatre,
and enjoy ourselves amazingly, eh?&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll come
with us, old fellow, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I consented.&nbsp; We took leave of the fair young
creature, and when we got to the bottom of the court, heard
strains of &ldquo;The Blue Alsatian Mountains&rdquo; trilling
over the flower-boxes on the window-sill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital girl that,&rdquo; said Teddy, pressing my arm;
&ldquo;good as gold&mdash;all heart, and that sort of
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; The expression of
one&rsquo;s real sentiments under such circumstances is not only
extremely ill-bred, but it <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>will most assuredly serve to fan the
flame in your friend&rsquo;s heart, and gain for yourself his
everlasting distrust.&nbsp; So I said &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;
and we tramped through Fleet Street, up Ludgate Hill, and turned
into the Old Bailey, closely followed by Teddy&rsquo;s little
clerk bearing Teddy&rsquo;s blue bag, with his initials
beautifully worked in white silk on the outside.</p>
<p>The case in which Teddy was concerned lasted all day.&nbsp;
But besides opening it in a somewhat abashed and hesitating way,
and thereafter cross-examining an utterly unimportant witness, I
could not see that Teddy had much more to do with the case than
myself, who had been accommodated with a seat in the row of
benches apportioned to the bar, situated just behind my
friend.&nbsp; All the real work was performed by Mr. Rowland,
Q.C., who prosecuted for the Treasury; and to his skill,
resource, and mastery of details, it appeared to me, the
conviction of the prisoner was entirely attributable.&nbsp; I
merely mention this because I subsequently heard Teddy take to
himself all the credit of having secured the verdict on that
memorable occasion.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>After
the unfortunate man in the dock had been sentenced and removed to
the seclusion of his cell, Teddy packed up his papers, stuffed
them into his bag, and leaving that receptacle to be removed by
his clerk, accompanied me back to Lime Court.&nbsp; The piano was
still going, and the voice of the siren gave forth the brisk
chorus of a bouffe drinking-song.</p>
<p>Topsy Varden must have visited her home with her mother in
Camden Town during our absence in Court, for she had abandoned
the white breakfast gown of the morning, and was arrayed in a
costly dinner dress, so arranged as to exhibit a great amount of
her arms and chest.&nbsp; As Teddy saluted her it was evident
that his admiration was sincere.&nbsp; Her reciprocal expression
was that of an actress&mdash;hollow, insincere, worthless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had such a win, Topsy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been bettin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Am I on?&rdquo; were
the rapid questions of this child of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little silly!&nbsp; I mean at the Old Bailey.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got my man convicted.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s to be hanged by
the neck until death by strangulation ensues.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;La!&rdquo; exclaimed Topsy.&nbsp; She would have
been much more interested if the win had been on the turf.&nbsp;
She, however, thought it well to add, &ldquo;What did he
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot a bobby&mdash;desperate character&mdash;think
he&rsquo;d have shot <i>me</i> if he&rsquo;d had a chance.&nbsp;
Funny defence that,&rdquo; he said, turning to me.</p>
<p>The defence had been that his brain had been turned&mdash;that
he had been a respectable working man until a dearly beloved
sister of his had left him and &ldquo;gone wrong.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
had been &ldquo;queer&rdquo; ever since, said some of the
witnesses.&nbsp; But that was surely no reason why he should go
about the streets shooting policemen.&nbsp; So the jury did its
duty and the judge did <i>his</i>&mdash;with a black cap on his
head.</p>
<p>As this explanation of the defence was given, I noticed that
Topsy&rsquo;s expressionless face grew pale, and her bosom rose
and fell quickly above her dress.&nbsp; Her voice was thick as
she asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;who&mdash;was&mdash;he?&nbsp;
What&mdash;was&mdash;his&mdash;name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend replied briefly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabez Omrod.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Topsy
sprang towards him with flashing eyes, as though to clutch his
throat; but before she could accomplish her object, she fell
back, and in falling moaned almost inarticulately,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have killed my brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Since that day Teddy has never held a brief, nor does he
appear anxious to hold one.&nbsp; His interest in the minor
ornaments of the drama has considerably abated.&nbsp; I know not
what has become of the ill-fated Topsy.&nbsp; Perhaps she has
returned for good to her mother in Camden Town.</p>

<i>BLUEBEARD&rsquo;S CUPBOARD</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Augustus Lincoln</span> was the
manager of the Theatre Royal, Sheppey Island.&nbsp; He was an
actor of the old school, and illustrated with great success the
charnel house department of dramatic literature.&nbsp; Regarded
simply from an artistic point of view, the performances given at
the Theatre Royal may be described as fine and even formidable
representations, but commercially considered they could scarcely
be regarded as triumphs.&nbsp; The Sheppey Islanders were, at the
time of which we are writing, people of a low and degraded taste,
and showed a grovelling preference for the entertainments given
at the music-halls.&nbsp; The permission to indulge in beer and
tobacco, which is accorded in Caves of Harmony, may <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>have had
something to do with this preference; but it must be admitted
that the Islanders considered &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Stranger,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Iron Chest,&rdquo; a trifle
gloomy, even when illuminated by the genius of Mr. Augustus
Lincoln.&nbsp; Indeed, had it not been for an accident, this
enterprising lessee and manager would have been obliged, long
before the incidents about to be related, to shut up his theatre
and appear in a highly popular <i>r&ocirc;le</i> on the stage of
the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s accident was the Amateur.&nbsp; That most
industrious and most sanguine of mortals, having hawked his
comedies, melodramas, and romantic plays to all the London
managers with all the customary want of success, determined that
Something must be Done.&nbsp; If caterers in the West End, blind
to their own interests, and careless of the intellectual
elevation of their patrons, refused to give him a show, as the
bald phraseology of the stage has it, the amateur, with fine
philanthropic feeling, determined to give himself a show.&nbsp;
Now the Theatre Royal, Sheppey Island, was very often closed, and
on such occasions, when he could raise a <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>sufficient
sum to pay for the advertisement, the circumstance was duly
announced in the <i>Era</i>.&nbsp; It was through the medium of
that highly diverting miscellany that Lincoln and the Amateur
were brought together.&nbsp; And from the moment that
introduction was effected, Lincoln never knew what it was to have
the brokers in the house, an incident which, up to that time, was
of not unfrequent occurrence.</p>
<p>The manager was an enthusiast in his way, and threw his whole
heart and soul into playing the leading characters in the amateur
comedies, melodramas, and romantic plays which he placed on his
stage.&nbsp; And the ambitious authors who resorted to this means
of publicity, were as a rule, so extremely pleased with the
histrionic efforts of Mr. Lincoln, that in addition to the sum
agreed upon for the representation, most of the mute inglorious
ones would insist on making a little present to the conscientious
manager-actor.&nbsp; But Mr. Lincoln was as proud as an Elliston,
and carried himself with as much dignity.&nbsp; So that whenever
the token of the Amateur&rsquo;s gratitude was offered in the
shape of money, the offended manager would draw himself grandly
up and <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>say, &ldquo;Sir, I cannot accept a gift of money;
though should you like to present me with a new hat, I shall not
say you nay.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Amateur usually took the hint, and
in a few days a band-box containing a hat, was duly delivered at
the stage door of the Theatre Royal.&nbsp; Yet strange to say, no
Sheppey Islander had ever seen Mr. Lincoln in a new hat.&nbsp;
Indeed, they had never seen him except in a very old one, which
by a judicious use of oil and a silk handkerchief, showed bravely
enough when cocked on the side of Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>It is, of course, easy to guess the reason of this.&nbsp; The
Amateur donors never thought of consulting their benefactor as to
the size of his head, or as to the peculiar shape which he most
affected.&nbsp; And so it happened, that not one of the
head-dresses sent to him was of any practical benefit.&nbsp; For
if it happened to be anything like a fit, it was sure to be of a
shape to which Mr. Lincoln would not condescend.&nbsp; He had
not, however, discarded them, but had placed them carefully in a
cupboard in his bedroom, which cupboard he always kept carefully
locked, carrying the key <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>of it on his bunch.&nbsp; At rare
intervals he would exhibit his collection to some old
crony&mdash;just as a collector would show his pictures, or a
connoisseur his cellar.&nbsp; Connected with each hat was a
memory.&nbsp; The entire assortment was a sort of history of the
Theatre Royal, Sheppey Island, and as he pointed out the trophies
he would couple with each the name of the amateur drama, the
triumphant success of which it was intended to commemorate.&nbsp;
Thus he would point to a tall beaver, with preposterous brim,
such as comic artists place on the head of John Bull, and
say,&mdash;&ldquo;That is my Queen of Circassia&rsquo;s
hat;&rdquo; or he would exhibit a light gossamer of most
undoubtedly dandaical proportions, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;That is
my Murdered Monk&rsquo;s hat;&rdquo;&mdash;so on through the
collection.&nbsp; There was a &ldquo;Prodigal Son&rsquo;s&rdquo;
hat, and an &ldquo;Act on the Square&rdquo; hat.&nbsp; The hat of
the &ldquo;Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;a Nautical Drama,&rdquo; and the
hat of &ldquo;The Little Pig that Paid the Rent; an Irish
Tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was more proud of his hats than of any other
circumstance connected with his theatrical career&mdash;save one,
and that <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>was, that Mr. Gladstone had seen him play Hamlet and
had expressed himself entirely satisfied with the
performance.</p>
<p>In an evil moment, and at the mature age of fifty-two, Mr.
Augustus Lincoln fell in love, and as often happens with the
intellectually great, he fell in love with the very last person
in the world whom he ought to have sought.&nbsp; Milly Brassey
was a pert, pink-cheeked, saucy-eyed beauty, who played
chamber-maid parts in his company.&nbsp; The Amateurs thought
very much of Milly, and as she was not proud in the matter of
receiving presents, it may be taken for granted that the sealskin
jacket and diamond rings came from the gifted creatures whose
works she had helped to illustrate.&nbsp; Off the stage she was a
giddy, giggling little woman, always ready for a flirtation, and
was madly loved by the <i>jeune premier</i>, and the low comedian
of the company.&nbsp; Indeed, it is a matter of notoriety that a
hostile meeting would have taken place between these jealous
lovers had it not transpired that Milly was about to be led to
the altar by the manager himself.&nbsp; So instead of meeting in
Greenwich Park over the murderous muzzles of revolvers, they met
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>in the
&ldquo;Goat and Compasses&rdquo; over two glasses of cold
gin.</p>
<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s wedding was a very quiet affair.&nbsp; After
all, no such very great change was to take place in the life of
the bride.&nbsp; She was already a member of Lincoln&rsquo;s
company.&nbsp; She had now become a member of his household as
well.&nbsp; Milly was a clever little actress, and if she did not
really love her husband, she made that devoted man think that she
did.&nbsp; His faith in her was unlimited, and although others
thought that she flirted alternately with Philip Beresford, the
<i>jeune premier</i>, and with Alf. Wild, the low comedian,
Lincoln with a firm belief in his wife&rsquo;s honesty and a
still firmer belief in his own charms, saw nothing
whatever.&nbsp; He was perfectly contented, and the amateurs,
increasing in perseverance and impatience, brought him month
after month new dramas for illustration, and new hats in token of
esteem.</p>
<p>All might have gone well had it not been for the hats.&nbsp;
Everybody in Lincoln&rsquo;s company wanted a hat.&nbsp; Neither
a <i>jeune premier</i>, nor a low comedian, can afford an
unstinted indulgence in hats on two pounds <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>a week,
even when that modest stipend is regularly paid.&nbsp; Actors
usually carry large ulster-cloaks that cover a multitude of
sins.&nbsp; But a bad hat or a bad boot is always <i>en
&eacute;vidence</i>.&nbsp; To say that Milly was gifted with
curiosity is simply to say that Milly was a woman.&nbsp; That she
soon began to question her husband as to the contents of the
locked cupboard, therefore goes without saying.&nbsp; But
although Lincoln would have trusted her with almost any other
secret, he was reticent concerning this.&nbsp; He had a sort of
prescience that the volatile Milly might turn his collection into
ridicule, and merely observing in answer to his wife&rsquo;s
queries that it was &ldquo;Bluebeard&rsquo;s Cupboard,&rdquo;
refused to be further cross-examined on the subject.&nbsp; Milly
promised not to annoy him any more in the matter, and religiously
kept her promise; only when he was out she tried every key in the
house on the lock that kept her from a delightful mystery, and at
last she found one that fitted, and opening
&ldquo;Bluebeard&rsquo;s Cupboard&rdquo; found it full,&mdash;not
of heads without hats, but of hats without heads.&nbsp; So full
was the cupboard of these samples of the hatter&rsquo;s art, that
she selected two, feeling <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>confident, that from so large a bag,
a brace would never be missed.&nbsp; These she secreted, and when
her husband returned (he had gone to meet an Amateur, who was big
with a tragedy called &ldquo;The Paralytic&rdquo;), she met him
with a kiss, and they were quite happy till it was time to go to
the theatre.</p>
<p>A week afterwards another Amateur wanted to see Mr.
Lincoln.&nbsp; On this occasion the appointment was made at a
Club in Adelphi Terrace.&nbsp; The interview was a short one, and
Mr. Lincoln was able to bend his steps eastward some two hours
before the time he had mentioned to Milly.&nbsp; He had to make a
call in Greenwich, and in the Main Street of that
highly-depressing village, he happened to look over the blind in
a pastrycook&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; He stopped suddenly, and
shouted in a tone of the utmost consternation, &ldquo;My
&lsquo;Murdered Monk&rsquo;s&rsquo; hat!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
after a pause, &ldquo;My &lsquo;Prodigal Son&rsquo;s&rsquo;
hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked again, and saw that the hats covered
the empty heads of Philip Beresford and Alf. Wild, between whom
sat his wife devouring open tarts, and laughing consumedly at her
own jokes.&nbsp; He entered stealthily, and soon heard enough to
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>show
that he, her husband, was the subject of her witticisms.&nbsp; He
strode up to them, and smashed the hats over the heads of the
wearers, calling them varlets and minions.&nbsp; The Amateur of
Adelphi Terrace had been good.&nbsp; So he was enabled to put his
hand in his waistcoat pocket, and withdraw six sovereigns.&nbsp;
Handing two to each, he said solemnly, &ldquo;In lieu of a
week&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Begone!&rdquo; and then on his wife
making a gesture of remonstrance, he said, in louder tones,
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye hear.&nbsp; <i>All</i> of ye.&nbsp;
Begone!&rdquo;&nbsp; They went.&nbsp; And he has never seen any
of them since.</p>

<i>TRUE TO POLL</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a splendid morning in the
leafy month of June&mdash;though down by the East India Docks
&ldquo;leafy&rdquo; is scarcely the adjective which one would
naturally select to qualify any month of the whole twelve.&nbsp;
It was the morning on which Jack Tarpey, mariner, led Polly
Andrews, spinster, to the altar.&nbsp; There is no altar in a
Registrar&rsquo;s Office, consequently the expression which I
have used must be regarded as somewhat figurative.&nbsp; But an
altar is by no means essential to the civil ceremony, and Jack
and Poll were as much married as if they had been united by the
Archbishop of Canterbury himself, assisted by all the
&ldquo;Honourable and Reverends&rdquo; in the service of the
Church of England, as by law <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>established.&nbsp; There, in a small
parlour near the Commercial Road, Jack and Poll were made man and
wife, or, to put it in the forcible language of the former,
&ldquo;had tied a knot with their lips as they couldn&rsquo;t
undo with their teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bride was accompanied by
a lady friend&mdash;for, alas! she was an orphan&mdash;while the
bridegroom was accompanied by his &ldquo;shipmet,&rdquo; young
Joey Copper, who was selected to discharge the onerous duties
devolving upon him, for a reason which may also be given in
Jack&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do I
&rsquo;ave Joey for my best man?&nbsp; Stan&rsquo; by, mate,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell ye.&nbsp; I &rsquo;ave&rsquo;s Joey for
my best man because he <i>is</i> the best man in all this
&rsquo;ere blessed world.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I
&rsquo;ave&rsquo;s Joey, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be
taken for granted that they saw; because no one, having once
asked the question, thought of putting it a second time.</p>
<p>Breakfast was provided at the residence of the landlord of the
bridegroom, a house of public entertainment, at the corner of one
of the somewhat melancholy streets abutting on the East India
Docks.&nbsp; The sign of the house was the &ldquo;Tartar
Frigate,&rdquo; and mine host had <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>obligingly set apart his back
parlour for the entertainment of Jack and his party, now
increased by an addition of two other
&ldquo;shipmets.&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord of the &ldquo;Tartar
Frigate&rdquo; was not, perhaps, a Gunter, but he understood the
tastes of his patrons, and gave them what he called &ldquo;a
greasy and substawnshul set out.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a fine
round of boiled beef, with carrots, boiled potatoes, and suet
dumplings of great weight and sappiness.&nbsp; Following this
there was a liberal dish of plum-duff; and to wind up with, there
was half a Dutch cheese and pats of butter, about the composition
of which, the less said here or elsewhere the better.&nbsp; The
more solid part of the repast having been removed, all hands were
piped to hot grog; a fiddler was introduced into the apartment,
and all was jollity and dancing, until some difference of opinion
arose between Jack&rsquo;s male guests, as to which of the three
should claim Poll&rsquo;s lady friend as a partner.&nbsp; Jack,
like the gallant and honest fellow that he was, stopped all
disputes by announcing that there was to be no quarrel on his
wedding-day, and that the proceedings, so far as he was
concerned, were at an end.&nbsp; Then the punctilious tar paid
the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>reckoning, and conveyed his wife to the apartments
which she had engaged for them in Belt Alley, E.</p>
<p>A life on the Ocean Wave is regarded by some as the most jolly
and enjoyable of all possible lives.&nbsp; But it must be
admitted that the Ocean Wave is a relentless master, and has no
more regard for the tender feelings of the mariner, and those who
are dear to him, than the whale that swallowed Jonah.&nbsp; Jack
and Poll had not been married three weeks, before his
ship&mdash;<i>The Promise of the May</i>&mdash;was ready for sea,
and Jack was ordered to join.&nbsp; Now I would call to my aid
that which is not permitted to the Unvarnished writer&mdash;the
lyre of the poet.&nbsp; For how shall I attune my harsh prose to
the music of their sighs, the liquid measure of their tears?</p>
<p>It came, that final, that inevitable scene.</p>
<p>They stood on the quay, his arms round her waist, her head on
his manly shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, lass,&rdquo; he whispered, as he drew the
back of his hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goo&mdash;goo&mdash;good-bye,&rdquo; she said, in an
agony of sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll always think o&rsquo; me, Poll?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;always,&rdquo; she cried,
shaken with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll always be true to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;always,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, lass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their lips met in a fervent salute.&nbsp; Then he was led away
to his ship by Joey Copper, his best man; and she, in a half
fainting, half hysterical state, was conducted back to her
apartments by her faithful female companion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was a splendid morning in the leafy month of
August&mdash;for Samuel Taylor Coleridge to the contrary, I
cannot conceive why June should be held to form a monopoly of
leafiness&mdash;and Billy Bunting of the <i>Avalanche</i> was
proceeding along Lantern Lane, close to the Docks, when he beheld
a female in distress.&nbsp; A hulking tramp with designs upon her
purse, had compelled the lady to stop, and she was crying in vain
to the great brick wall on either side, to help her.&nbsp; To
&ldquo;bear down upon&rdquo; them, to call upon the villain to
&ldquo;belay there;&rdquo; to knock him senseless in the roadway,
and to offer his assistance to beauty in distress&mdash;to do all
this, was, as is well-known to those conversant with <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>the
literature of the Rolling Deep&mdash;the work of a moment.</p>
<p>Billy loved a pretty face, and it was a pretty-one, of that
plump and red kind so admired by sailors, which through tears
looked up at Billy now.&nbsp; Giving the prostrate form of the
tramp a kick, he gallantly offered his arm to the maiden,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tow you out of the way of that skulking
land-shark, my beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, nothing displeased, took the offered arm; and declared
that she was &ldquo;<i>so</i> obliged she couldn&rsquo;t
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; wot&rsquo;s yer name, my pretty
poppet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; she replied, with a blush that enhanced
her many charms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yer t&rsquo;other name is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; she replied, coyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Wot d&rsquo;ye think of Bunting as a
name&mdash;come now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetly bee-utiful,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a tone that betokened a
delighted surprise.</p>
<p>Those who make long voyages must needs put up with short
courtships, and Billy Bunting <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>had not been many days acquainted
with Miss Smith before she had promised to be his, and the
marriage was duly solemnised at the Little Bethel, Lancington
St., by Mr. Morth, the esteemed pastor of that conventicle.&nbsp;
They spent the day at Gravesend, enjoying its natural and
artificial beauties, including the Rosherville Gardens, where
they were almost as happy as the advertisements of that
pleasaunce would lead one to suppose.&nbsp; And then they
returned to their humble lodging in Belt Alley, E.</p>
<p>Alas! for the brevity of human happiness.&nbsp; Poor Polly
Andrews was no sooner married to her Jack Tarpey than the
<i>Promise of the May</i> was ordered on a twelve months&rsquo;
voyage.&nbsp; And Polly Smith has been but a brief fortnight the
adored wife of Billy Bunting when the <i>Avalanche</i> is ready
to go sailing about the world for a similar period.&nbsp; But,
cheer up, brave hearts!&nbsp; Courage, dear souls!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sweet little Cherub that
sits up aloft<br />
To keep watch o&rsquo;er the life of poor Jack.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the little Cherub who, from that elevated position, is
solicitous concerning the <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>well-being of poor Jack, will no
doubt exhibit an equal solicitude in the case of poor Billy
Bunting.&nbsp; But it is useless to preach philosophy to breaking
hearts.&nbsp; It was a sad scene that which took place on the
quay as Polly bid her Bill adieu.&nbsp; She could but hope; he
could but hope, and a year after all is only three hundred and
sixty-five miserable little days.&nbsp; It will soon be over.</p>
<p>But the <i>Avalanche</i> was not to be a year out of port.</p>
<p>And here comes the interesting part of this strange
narrative.</p>
<p>At the beginning of September, in the year of which I am
writing, a very violent and lasting gale burst over certain
Northern latitudes.&nbsp; And nowhere was that gale felt more
severely than in the Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; Many lives were lost in
that ill-omened water&mdash;for why it should be called a
&ldquo;Bay&rdquo; while the Adriatic is called a
&ldquo;Sea,&rdquo; I have never since the happy days of boyhood
been able to discover.&nbsp; The waves rose mountains high, the
wind blew a hurricane, and everything that out-lived the first
fury of the elements scudded along under bare poles.&nbsp; That
everything <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>did <i>not</i> out-live the first fury of the elements
will appear presently.</p>
<p>One of the vessels encountering that memorable storm was the
<i>Avalanche</i>.&nbsp; She encountered it, and overcame it, but
with considerable loss to herself.&nbsp; Her mainmast had been
snapped in two like a brittle twig.&nbsp; Her canvas was in
shreds, part of her bulwarks was swept away, and the pumps were
continually at work, to lessen the volume of water that half
filled her hold.&nbsp; Though all was calm now, she could not
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she lay&rdquo; several days, &ldquo;in the Bay of
Biscay O!&rdquo;&nbsp; At last the inevitable &ldquo;sail in
sight appeared.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a sail however that promised
no assistance.&nbsp; For when examined through the glass it
appeared to be a raft, with a solitary human being on
board.&nbsp; There was much speculation as it bore down upon
them; at last the raft touched the <i>Avalanche</i>, and its sole
occupant, worn out with hunger, thirst, anxiety, and fear, was
helped up the side of the <i>Avalanche</i>, and fell upon the
deck in a faint that looked uncommonly like death.&nbsp;
Unremitting attention and a judicious administration of rum
brought him to; and when <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>he was sufficiently restored he
informed his rescuers that his name was Jack Tarpey, of the
<i>Promise of the May</i>; which doomed vessel having encountered
the late gales in the Bay succumbed to the last and worst, and
went down with all hands, save three who had taken to the raft,
His two companions had died of cold and exhaustion.&nbsp; He
alone survived of all the crew.</p>
<p>Billy Bunting was a tender-hearted fellow, and &ldquo;took
to&rdquo; this shipwrecked mariner.&nbsp; They became indeed such
chums that Jack bade fair to forget the excellent Joey Copper:
now no more.&nbsp; At last relief came to the <i>Avalanche</i>,
and the disabled vessel was assisted on her homeward way.&nbsp;
As the days sped on, the friendship between Jack and Billy
increased.&nbsp; They had a bond of sympathy in common.&nbsp;
Both had married Polls, and both these Polls lived in Belt Alley,
E.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s that fond o&rsquo; me, Jack&mdash;bless
her,&rdquo; Billy would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she do love me, Bill&mdash;bless &rsquo;er old
&rsquo;art,&rdquo; Jack would reply.</p>
<p>It was a long and weary business getting the <i>Avalanche</i>
into dock.&nbsp; And it was a long <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>and weary time before Bill and Jack
were allowed to go ashore&mdash;for Jack had joined the crew of
the <i>Avalanche</i>.&nbsp; But the day of emancipation did
eventually arrive.&nbsp; And more exultant mariners never left a
ship.&nbsp; Neither of these happy-go-lucky sons of Neptune could
remember the number of his house in Belt Alley, but each could
swear to the external appearance of it.&nbsp; So they chartered a
four-wheeler, and as they drove down the alley each had his eye
on the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted Bill, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my
&rsquo;ouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; echoed Jack, thinking that
affairs were now culminating towards a coincidence.&nbsp; A blind
was pulled suddenly down, and cabby thought he heard boys
practising with a pistol in the back-yard.&nbsp; The mariners
heard nothing.&nbsp; They were both knocking at the same
door.&nbsp; There was no answer.&nbsp; They knocked again.&nbsp;
Still no answer.&nbsp; They broke the door down.&nbsp; On the
floor lay a plump, red-faced girl, shot through the heart, a
pistol in her hand.&nbsp; Both exclaimed at the same
moment,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On searching her boxes, they found that <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>she had
piously preserved copies of the certificates of her marriage to
each&mdash;together with vouchers for two other unions since
contracted.</p>

<i>JOHN PHILP</i>, <i>MASTER CARPENTER</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> ten years ago Mr. Landor was
the lessee and manager of the Lugubreum Theatre, and John Philp
was his master carpenter.&nbsp; In those days the staple of the
Lugubreum entertainment was melodrama, preceded by farce.&nbsp;
Mr. Landor found Philp, who was about thirty-five years of age,
exceedingly useful.&nbsp; He was quick, intelligent, and
ingenious.&nbsp; He had been brought up to the stage-carpentering
business from his earliest days, and had omitted to soak his
faculties in gin, as is too often the practice with gentlemen of
his profession.&nbsp; Philp&rsquo;s powers of invention were
indeed notorious, and many famous contrivances, without which
certain celebrated sensational scenes must have miserably failed,
could be traced to his <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>suggestions.&nbsp; He was, withal, a
modest, cheery-little fellow, much beloved by his associates, and
greatly respected by his employer, who regarded him as one of his
most valuable allies.</p>
<p>John Philp lived in a part of old Camberwell, that had not
then been disturbed by the invasion of the speculative
builder.&nbsp; He rented a substantially built little cottage of
five rooms, with quite a large garden in the back.&nbsp;
Philp&rsquo;s gardening was, it must be admitted, of a somewhat
theatrical kind.&nbsp; He had erected a flagstaff painted in
stripes, on the top of which was a weather-cock of his own
contrivance&mdash;an indicator which to the very last he believed
told him what way the wind blew.&nbsp; At the end of the garden
was a formidable grotto&mdash;the effect of which was somewhat
marred by the introduction of pieces of coloured glass.&nbsp; On
the side walk were placed two wooden pedestals, also painted in
various bright colours; upon these stood statuettes of his
favourite great men.&nbsp; Upon one was William
Shakespear&mdash;copied from the famous work once erected in
Garrick&rsquo;s Villa, and now standing in the British
Museum.&nbsp; And upon <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the other was Mr. Dion Boucicault,
appealing to the dog Tatters&mdash;an animal which is often
alluded to in the <i>Shaughraun</i>, but never appears in that
interesting production.</p>
<p>John Philp&rsquo;s widowed mother lived with him in Artesian
Cottages, and kept house for him.&nbsp; She was a brisk,
wholesome-looking old lady, and was very proud of her
son&mdash;as indeed she had a right to be&mdash;and would grow
garrulous about his merits, his personal beauty, and his
infantile maladies, at the mere mention of his name.&nbsp; John
was very much attached to the old lady&mdash;devoting his Sunday
afternoons to her entertainment.&nbsp; What happy days those were
when she sat in an arbour in the Greyhound at Dulwich, drinking
tea, while John sipped his ale and smoked his pipe.&nbsp; What
royal times, too, when the funds permitted a trip to Gravesend;
and when shrimps and most marvellous water-cresses formed an
addition to the feast.&nbsp; And what words can describe that
period of delirious excitement when a buoyant exchequer and the
closing of the Lugubreum for repairs, permitted that memorable
week at Margate.&nbsp; Alas! such happiness was to be
short-lived.&nbsp; And the <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>beginning of the sorrow of Mrs.
Philp was to be mysteriously bound up with the success in this
country of <i>opera bouffe</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Landor was an astute man, and had no exalted notion of his
functions as a manager.&nbsp; He laughed at those who prated
about &ldquo;High Art,&rdquo; and the rest of it, and spoke of
himself as a business man, whose object in life was to make
money, by supplying a certain commodity for which there existed a
public demand.&nbsp; Now the public demand for melodrama and
farce became very slack.&nbsp; Heavy villains and sensational
&ldquo;sets&rdquo; became a drug in the market; and Mr. Landor
having duly weighed the pros and cons of the matter, determined
to alter the character of his theatre and make <i>opera
bouffe</i> his leading suit.&nbsp; Old supporters of the
Lugubreum growled.&nbsp; But the public came.&nbsp; The
dissemination of paper was stopped.&nbsp; The free list was
entirely suspended.&nbsp; And the Lugubreum was doing a roaring
trade.&nbsp; Philp still held his position as head carpenter,
with labours necessarily lightened, but with salary
undiminished.</p>
<p>For the successful illustration of burlesque, one of the most
essential elements is a chorus <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>of shapely young women, who have no
objection to as liberal a display of their personal charms as a
manager may deem advisable.&nbsp; And among the chorus ladies
engaged to Mr. Landor was Miss Carry Adair.&nbsp; This
fascinating damsel was the daughter of a lodging-house keeper in
Islington, named O&rsquo;Flaherty, and in assisting her
mother&mdash;whose education had been somewhat neglected&mdash;to
cook the accounts of the young city gentlemen who lodged with
them, acquired those habits of caution and economy, which have
characterised her throughout her career.&nbsp; At the age of
eighteen she left her mother&rsquo;s care, and was employed by a
court dressmaker in Bond Street in the capacity of a live model,
to display to their best advantage the goods of her
employer.&nbsp; While acting in this useful, if humble capacity,
she was seen by Sir Mornington Cresswell, who had come to inspect
a court dress ordered by Lady Cresswell.&nbsp; Sir Mornington is
a well-known philanthropist, and took an immediate interest in
the young woman, urging her to take suitable apartments in the
region abutting on Regent&rsquo;s Park, and finally obtaining for
her an engagement at <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the Lugubreum.&nbsp; Sir Mornington
being one of those reserved and unassuming Christians, who do not
let the left hand know what the right is doing, kept the latest
instance of his kindly and discriminating philanthropy a secret
from his wife.</p>
<p>Carry Adair was a great success in her new vocation.&nbsp; She
was tall, of liberal contour, had big expressionless eyes, and
masses of magnificent brown hair.&nbsp; It was her mission in
life to be &ldquo;a doosid fine woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The callow
connoisseurs of the stalls proclaimed her to be a &ldquo;doosid
fine woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so her reputation was made, although
as far as histrionic capability is concerned, she was absolutely
devoid of it.&nbsp; She was withal, an excessively discreet young
person, and was never known to indulge in the unseemly jests,
which, in the dressing-rooms, formed the current coin of
conversation; and, indeed, had been known on many occasions to
rebuke her companions when a <i>double entendre</i> offended her
keen susceptibilities.&nbsp; It was this trait in her character
which won the sympathies of John Philp.&nbsp; He was sensible, no
doubt, of her merely physical attributes.&nbsp; But he regarded
<a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>her as
an innocent and artless girl, thrown into the society of those
who were by no means particular.&nbsp; He longed to shield her
from the evil which is in the world, and as a preliminary to this
missionary enterprise he fell hopelessly in love with her.&nbsp;
He had given himself, body and soul, to the thrall of a woman who
had no more capacity for an honest affection than the table upon
which I am writing.</p>
<p>And she&mdash;what did she do?&nbsp; She led him on.&nbsp; She
permitted him to hold her heavy sealskin as she enveloped herself
in it.&nbsp; She permitted him to kiss the diamonds that covered
her fingers.&nbsp; And then in the very dressing-room where she
would not permit the use of an indelicate expression, she
mimicked the comic agony of her lover, for the edification of the
Lotties and the Totties who shrieked with laughter at her
irresistible sallies.&nbsp; For Carry was not without a certain
flow of vulgar humour, which she had acquired probably while
waiting on her young city gentlemen in the Islingtonian
lodging-house.&nbsp; On the evening when poor John Philp brought
himself to ask the awful question, she was <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>particularly amusing.&nbsp; She showed how he blushed
and stammered as he described his little place in Camberwell; how
he spoke of his mother&rsquo;s devotion; and the happy effects of
living on a gravel soil.&nbsp; Then she narrated with some spirit
how she squeezed his hand, and begged for time to consider the
proposal.&nbsp; Carry being the possessor of some means, was in
the habit of treating her friends of the dressing room; so her
jokes all took immensely, and the Lotties and Totties agreed that
poor John Philp was an &ldquo;old stoopid.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About a fortnight after John Philp&rsquo;s proposal, Landor
was coming down the steps of Evans&rsquo;s Hotel in Covent Garden
at twelve o&rsquo;clock one night.&nbsp; He was passed on the
steps by Miss Adair, enveloped in a white satin opera cloak, and
apparently in full evening dress.&nbsp; She was on the arm of a
young gentleman with a little yellow moustache&mdash;an <i>avant
courrier</i> of that Crutch and Toothpick Brigade which has since
become famous.&nbsp; The manager saw her enter a brougham which
was waiting in front.&nbsp; She was followed by the young
gentleman, and was driven rapidly off.&nbsp; <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>The vehicle
was followed on foot by a man with pale face and livid lips, and
without any hat on.&nbsp; In the face of that pursuing figure,
Mr. Landor recognised John Philp, the master carpenter.&nbsp; And
being a man of the world he shrugged his shoulders, lit another
cigarette, and went on to the Garrick Club, of which institution
he is one of the most agreeable ornaments.</p>
<p>John Philp never again entered the stage-door of the
Lugubreum.&nbsp; He threw up his situation, alleging illness as
an excuse.&nbsp; He wanted change of air.&nbsp; Landor regretted
his determination, and looked out for somebody to take his
place.&nbsp; Three months after he received a letter from his old
<i>employ&eacute;</i>, asking him &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s
sake&rdquo; to come and see him.&nbsp; Landor went; Artesian
Cottage had evidently been somewhat neglected.&nbsp; The creepers
were trailing about in slovenly branches, and the little garden
path was covered with grass.&nbsp; Mrs. Philp looked worn and
weary, and accompanied with sobs the answers which she gave the
manager.&nbsp; She led the way into her son&rsquo;s
bedroom.&nbsp; He was a shadow of his former self, but a smile
overspread his countenance <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>as he recognised his old
master.&nbsp; He stretched his poor transparent hand across the
counterpane, and grasping the manager&rsquo;s hand, said
feebly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> kind of you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he motioned his mother to leave the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m breaking up fast, sir,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but afore I go I wished to give you
something&mdash;as&mdash;as a keepsake.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been a
good friend to me, sir, but I&rsquo;m afraid I seemed
ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager answered him that he had always valued and
respected him.</p>
<p>Then John put his hand under the pillow, and drew out a ring
with a small diamond set in it.&nbsp; This he handed to
Landor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought it for her,&rdquo; he stuttered; &ldquo;I
wanted to show her that a working man could buy jewels as well as
the swells.&nbsp; I pinched myself to get it, an&rsquo; the very
night I &rsquo;ad it in my pocket to give her, I followed her
&rsquo;ome to&mdash;to&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say it, sir&mdash;it
chokes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landor took the ring.&nbsp; The master carpenter fell back on
his pillow.&nbsp; An expression of satisfied calm was upon his
face.&nbsp; The <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>great change was coming.&nbsp; Landor summoned his
mother.&nbsp; Hearing her voice John Philp opened his eyes and
stared round the room.&nbsp; Then he raised himself, and with a
last dying effort shrieked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the di&rsquo;monds as does it; damn
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell back, and Landor closed his eyes and drew the sheet
over his face.</p>

<i>PICTURES ON THE LINE</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> through his own part of the
country John Osbaldiston was familiarly known as
&ldquo;Nails.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this expressive locution was
adopted in the first place to indicate the business out of which
the millionaire had amassed his fortune; and in the second place
to give some necessarily inadequate notion of the hardness of his
nature.&nbsp; As John Osbaldiston was a millionaire it may be
taken for granted that his nick-name was never mentioned before
his face.&nbsp; Besides being the possessor of enormous wealth
the retired nail-maker was a Justice of the Peace, a
Deputy-Lieutenant, and lived in confident expectation that when
the Radicals came in&mdash;if they ever <i>did</i> come
in&mdash;he should be rewarded for his unswerving <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>devotion by
a baronetcy.&nbsp; The beauty of this hope was somewhat marred
when Osbaldiston reflected that his wife was dead, and that he
had no son to inherit the title.&nbsp; He was a hard, pompous
man, full of prejudices, and the happiest moments of his life
were those which he spent upon the bench sentencing the peccant
rustics.&nbsp; Fortunately for the country side, John Osbaldiston
never sat on the bench alone, and his own view as to the
depravity of human nature could not take effect in sentences
unless a majority of the bench was with him.&nbsp; And the
majority never was with him.</p>
<p>John Osbaldiston&rsquo;s father had founded the business in
the town of Belchester and had purchased the estate upon which
John now lived, and to which he had greatly added; absorbing the
estates of the smaller country gentlemen as in other days he had
absorbed the business of the smaller nail-makers.&nbsp; The house
on the estate was a large, solid building, without any
pretensions to architectural beauty, but capable of holding in
its vast apartments half the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the county,
if half the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the county should ever feel
inclined to visit it together.&nbsp; John Osbaldiston was a great
<a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>picture
buyer, and his galleries were the envy of his neighbours, and
even of patrons of the Fine Arts living at a distance.&nbsp;
Indeed, the fame of the Osbaldiston collection had travelled
almost as far as his nails.&nbsp; He was not much of a
critic.&nbsp; Some people said that he was not much of a judge,
but bought pictures as farmers buy sheep&mdash;by the
brand.&nbsp; Whatever truth there may be in these reflections,
one thing is certain, that many of the best examples of the most
esteemed painters had found their way into the galleries of
Bradland Hall&mdash;as the Osbaldiston house was called.&nbsp;
Whether the contemplation of these accumulated works of art gave
the millionaire any artistic pleasure it is impossible to say;
but he was very proud of their possession, and it gave him an
exquisite sense of satisfaction when at any sale in London his
agent outbid the agent of his blue-blooded neighbour, the Duke of
Sandown, for the possession of an example which both were anxious
to acquire.&nbsp; But, notwithstanding this pride of possession,
the nail-maker of Belchester was not ostentatious.&nbsp; His
nature was a puzzle.&nbsp; He was as inscrutable as he was
hard.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>The
Master of Bradland Hall had one possession which gave him more
anxiety than all his other treasures put together; and that
possession was his daughter Bella, a thoughtless, light-hearted,
high-spirited girl of seventeen, who had been a source of untold
trouble to a succession of nursery-governesses, governesses,
masters, mistresses, and professors.&nbsp; Her nature was as soft
as the paternal nature was hard.&nbsp; She was easily led, though
difficult to drive, and worst of all, was not awed to any
appreciable extent by the frowns of her father, when he did frown
at her, which, comparatively speaking, was seldom.&nbsp; What
little affection he had to bestow was given to his only
child&mdash;the child of his old age; and it must be admitted at
once, that if Bella reciprocated the affection, she had a most
undemonstrative way of doing it.&nbsp; The daughter had a way of
putting her father down, which amounted almost to snubbing.&nbsp;
Done in private, the old gentleman bore such unfilial ebullitions
in silence; though when performed before the menials he resented
it with great bitterness.&nbsp; I have already said that John
Osbaldiston was full of prejudices.&nbsp; For the <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>purposes of
this narrative it is necessary to mention but one of them.&nbsp;
He had a rooted antipathy to railways and everything connected
with them.&nbsp; This was no doubt strange in a man who had made
his money in connection with iron, and whose commercial course
was entirely connected with the manufacturing town of
Belchester.&nbsp; But his rooted antipathy may be accounted for
by the fact that, on two occasions he came into collision with a
railway company&mdash;not on the lines, but in the law
courts&mdash;and that on each occasion he was beaten by the
defendant company.&nbsp; The first occasion was a mere affair
connected with alleged negligence resulting in the loss of a
consignment of nails.&nbsp; But the second occasion was when the
Great Nor&rsquo;-West by Western Railway Company proposed to have
a branch line from Belchester to Balt&mdash;a little village
situated on the Bradland estate.&nbsp; Osbaldiston spent
thousands and thousands in opposing the Bill, and when finally it
was passed, went to law on the question of compensation; though,
on a fine night, with the wind blowing towards him, the shriek of
the engine could barely be heard at the Hall.&nbsp; It was then
<a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>that
John Osbaldiston declared his eternal hatred of all railways
whatsoever, and swore a great oath that he would never travel by
that means of transit, so long as there was any other mode of
conveyance available.</p>
<p>In the early spring of 1879, John Osbaldiston was sitting in
his library delivering himself of portentous platitudes on the
subject of frivolity, for the edification of Miss Bella, when the
afternoon post arrived, and brought a letter bearing the
Belchester postmark.&nbsp; Having perused it, John Osbaldiston
settled his neck in his collar, and handed the communication to
his daughter, who read it out with many interjections of
disapproval.&nbsp; The following is a copy of the letter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Belchester Institute</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Belchester</span> &mdash;, 1879.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A Committee
having been appointed to consider the long-mooted question of
opening a Loan Exhibition of Works of Art, in connection with the
Institute, it has been resolved to hold the proposed Exhibition
in the summer of the present year.&nbsp; Regarding your own long
and honourable connection with the town, it has been resolved to
consult you generally on the subject, and to request you to lend
us a few examples from your magnificent collection.&nbsp; When it
is known that you have contributed to the walls of our <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>Exhibition,
the example upon the minds of other collectors will be
prodigious, and the success of our efforts be secured.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your obedient servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Amos Black</span>, <i>Hon. Sec.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Osbaldiston</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq.</span>, J.P., D.L.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never,&rdquo; exclaimed Bella.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such impudence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing impudent about it,&rdquo; replied the
father, sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I owe everything to
Belchester.&nbsp; Belchester shall not find me
ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, dear papa.&nbsp; But supposing
Belchester rewards your gratitude by poking its umbrellas through
your Titians or by cutting little bits out of your
Turners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belchester has trusted <i>me</i>.&nbsp; <i>I</i> will
trust Belchester,&rdquo; replied her parent, pompously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> send to Belchester,&rdquo;
she said, trying another tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there is no way of sending them except by the
Great Nor&rsquo;-West by Western Railway Company&rsquo;s branch
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall go by van,&rdquo; he replied decisively.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>And
there was an end of the matter.</p>
<p>The distance between Bradland Hall and Belchester is nearly
thirty miles, and when John Osbaldiston had replied to the
Secretary of the Belchester Institute, graciously according to
the request of the Committee, he personally saw to the selection
and packing of the pictures, in a van also selected with great
care.&nbsp; He made arrangement for a change of horses on the
road, and he consigned the precious cargo to two men, in whose
steadiness, and sobriety, and general possession of character, he
could place the utmost confidence.&nbsp; These selected
characters quite justified the confidence reposed in them, and
drove so steadily and so slowly, that the roadside population
might have supposed the van to contain a corpse.</p>
<p>Two miles from Belchester there is a level crossing; and over
this crossing the van containing Osbaldiston&rsquo;s masterpieces
had to be taken.&nbsp; Just as the hoofs of the off horse left
the up line his knees seemed to give way, he fell, and seemed
unable to get up again.&nbsp; Every effort was made to raise him;
but in vain.&nbsp; Then attempts were made to move the van which
stood right across the rails.&nbsp; But <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>too
late.&nbsp; It all seemed to occur in a moment.&nbsp; The express
came rushing up.&nbsp; The van was knocked into matchwood, and
the masterpieces from Bradland Hall were master <i>pieces</i>
indeed&mdash;mere fragments of frame and canvas, some strewed by
the side of the line, and some adhering to the engine and
carriages of the express, which lay on its side a short distance
further on.</p>
<p>A telegram brought John Osbaldiston to the spot in process of
time.&nbsp; And he spent many days in Belchester mad with
himself, with the Institute, with the railway, and with the world
in general.&nbsp; When he returned home his anger was
increased.&nbsp; He found a letter from Bella:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Pa</span>.&mdash;I
knew you would never consent, so I have run away to be
married.&nbsp; He is a man very highly connected, but has been
unfortunate, and is at present a guard on the Nor&rsquo;-West by
Western.&nbsp; He is so handsome, and we are so happy.&nbsp; Do
forgive us.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Bella</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried the crushed nail-maker.&nbsp; And
he never did.</p>

evidence.&nbsp; But in all probability it had been sent to the
Vicar, and the wife of that worthy clergyman, who had an
insatiable thirst for the knowledge that is to be obtained from
advertisements, came upon this &ldquo;Want&rdquo; of Mrs.
Gillison, and brought it before the notice of Susan
Copeland.&nbsp; Susan was the model villager, the prize-girl of
Stockbury, and having served brilliantly as an under nurse to the
Vicar&rsquo;s family, she was now anxious, as the saying goes,
&ldquo;to better herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Susan was a tall
brown-eyed girl.&nbsp; She affected great simplicity in her
dress, wore her hair brushed flat down on her forehead, and in a
general way looked more like a Puritan maiden than is customary
with the daughters of Kentish farmers.&nbsp; Susan was eighteen
years of age, and was engaged to Thomas Ash.&nbsp; As Susan
Copeland was the model girl of Stockbury, it was only right that
she should become engaged to the model young man.&nbsp; And that
young man was Tom.&nbsp; He had secured all the prizes in the
Boys&rsquo; department, while she had been sedulously engaged in
acquiring all the honours from the Girls&rsquo;.&nbsp; Indeed,
these two swooped down upon the <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>prize list, and by reason of their
superior attainments and conspicuous virtue swept off all before
them.</p>
<p>Satisfied with the Vicar&rsquo;s report, Mrs. Gillison of
Thornton Heath engaged Susan in the real and somewhat unusual
capacity of &ldquo;Housemaid and Companion&rdquo; at a yearly
salary of &pound;20, which to a Stockbury girl appeared a
tolerable fortune.&nbsp; And it was arranged that Thomas Ash
should take his betrothed to London, and deliver her safely at
the house of Mrs. Gillison.&nbsp; There was much sorrow in the
village of Stockbury, when Susan took her departure for the great
metropolis, and her boxes contained many tokens of the
affectionate esteem in which she was held by her
contemporaries.&nbsp; All thoughts of rivalry were now lost in a
universal sentiment of sorrow.&nbsp; It was felt that in losing
Miss Copeland, Stockbury was robbed of much of its moral
lustre.&nbsp; It is not necessary to enumerate the presents which
her friends forced upon her.&nbsp; Most of them had taken the
shape of literature, and ranged from the &ldquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter&rdquo; to the hymnal of the inimitable Watts; from
&ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s Saints&rsquo; <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Rest&rdquo; presented by the Vicar
to a highly coloured history of Jack and the Beanstalk, the gift
of a small brother.&nbsp; So beloved, respected, and lamented,
Susan left her native village proudly escorted by the man who
hereafter was to lead her to the altar.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gillison, when she had duly inspected, cross-examined,
and examined-in-chief her new &ldquo;housemaid and
companion,&rdquo; professed herself entirely satisfied; and
Susan, who had a fine literary taste of her own, was delighted to
find that her duties would be very light and that she would have
the coveted leisure in which to improve her mind.&nbsp; Mrs.
Gillison was an active, smart little woman, who did her own
cooking.&nbsp; There was, moreover, a boy kept on the premises to
carry coal, clean boots, and perform other menial offices.&nbsp;
Indeed, Susan&rsquo;s duties were, in the first place, to keep
clean the few rooms, of which Lambird Cottage consisted, and to
afford to Mrs. Gillison that companionship which is found
desirable by widow ladies of a certain age.&nbsp; Mrs. Gillison
was not a lady of much education&mdash;her husband had been a
pork butcher in the Walworth Road&mdash;and it was part of <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Susan&rsquo;s duty to read to her in the evening the
entertaining fictions which she purchased when she took her walks
abroad.&nbsp; The old lady was omniverous, but chiefly relished
the stirring fictions compiled by the Penny Dreadful authors, and
at times had appetite for such boy&rsquo;s literature as dealt
with pirates or robbers, or the wild Indians of the West.&nbsp;
Dickens she rated &ldquo;a low feller,&rdquo; but she revelled in
Ouida, and was particularly partial to the earlier fictions of
Bulwer Lytton.&nbsp; Susan Copeland&rsquo;s excursions into the
field of fiction had hitherto gone no further than
&ldquo;Ministering Children,&rdquo; and other books with a
religious purpose.&nbsp; Her mind, therefore, became greatly
expanded while reading for her mistress, and she became possessed
of many views of life, which were to her at once strange and
stimulating.</p>
<p>When Susan had been three months with the widow of the pork
butcher her mistress handed her five golden sovereigns, that
being the amount of wages then due, and Susan went out to the
contiguous village of Croydon to purchase a new bonnet.&nbsp; She
had never before purchased a head-dress so fashionable.&nbsp; <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Her tastes,
however, had improved since she left the little village of
Stockbury, and she wanted a bonnet which would suit the new style
of doing her hair; for, with the consent of her mistress, she no
longer wore her hair brushed flat down on the forehead like a
Puritan, but adopted the fashionable &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; just
then, to the eternal shame of English womanhood, coming into
vogue.&nbsp; A &ldquo;housemaid and companion&rdquo; is a more
privileged person than a housemaid, or a companion, and when
Susan returned from Croydon with her purchase she walked into
Mrs. Gillison&rsquo;s sitting-room without knocking at the
door.&nbsp; Mrs. Gillison was sitting at the table and started
when her servant entered&mdash;started, then grew pale, then grew
red, and then looked down with a shamefaced expression, more like
that of a peccant school-girl than that of a grown woman.&nbsp;
On the table before her lay a pack of cards with their faces
exposed.&nbsp; Mrs. Gillison had, in fact, been discovered in the
act of playing &ldquo;Patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be
ridiculous to assert that the mere act of engaging in this very
monotonous and even foolish pursuit is wicked in itself, and
should occasion a blush on the <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>cheek of matured innocence.&nbsp;
But Susan Copeland had been brought up to consider cards the
devil&rsquo;s plaything, and Mrs. Gillison had often heard her
express her opinions on the subject, when she happened upon an
allusion to the card-table in any of the novels which she
read.&nbsp; Indeed, so great was the confusion of the widow at
being discovered in the midst of an occupation which that model
Sunday scholar regarded with honest and hearty aversion that not
only did she blush, she added to her sin by uttering a deliberate
falsehood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;was only tellin&rsquo; my
fortune,&rdquo; she said in an apologetic tone.</p>
<p>But in the countenance of her maid she saw pictured neither
aversion nor reproach, but only awakened interest and active
curiosity.&nbsp; She took up a King and an Ace, regarded them
carefully, and then said slowly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so these are real cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much relieved her mistress answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t much harm in
&rsquo;em, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to <i>look</i> at,&rdquo; replied the cautious
handmaiden.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I suppose the wickedness is in
playing with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;Not a bit.&nbsp; There never was a better man
than my husband, and me an&rsquo; him played cribbage every night
of our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan never took her eyes off the King and Ace which she still
held.&nbsp; She was fascinated.&nbsp; She had even forgotten
about her new bonnet.&nbsp; She said in a dreamy, half-conscious
sort of way,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it must be in the playing the wickedness
is.&nbsp; I would like to see what it is.&nbsp; Will you show
me&mdash;so that I may avoid it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in her life did Mrs. Gillison comply more willingly with
a request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear, of course.&nbsp; Sit down opposite
me there.&nbsp; Pick &rsquo;em all up.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right.&nbsp; Now hand &rsquo;em to me.&nbsp; This is the way we
shuffle.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see?&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s the way we
cut.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no harm in that, is there?&nbsp; Now run
an&rsquo; fetch the cribbage board off my chest of drawers.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a long board with ivory in it, an&rsquo; a lot of
little holes at the side.&nbsp; Run along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another half hour Susan had begun to master the intricacies
of the game, and was pegging away with an ardour which astonished
even Mrs. Gillison, who was delighted at this <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>new
departure.&nbsp; The last words she said to herself as she turned
into bed were,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a treasure that girl is to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to relate the following evening found Mrs. Gillison
and Susan Copeland sitting at the same table with the same
cribbage board between them, evincing the same determined
interest in the game.&nbsp; Susan had quite made up her mind that
she had not yet arrived at the sinful phase of card playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she ventured on this occasion,
&ldquo;that the sin of it is when you play for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see no sin in playin&rsquo; for
money.&nbsp; Me an&rsquo; my husband always played sixpence a
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose&mdash;suppose,&rdquo; said Susan, doubtfully,
&ldquo;that we try&mdash;just to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gillison was delighted.&nbsp; She was at heart as
determined a gambler as ever punted at Monaco.&nbsp; She had now
discovered in her Paragon the only virtue in which she had
considered her wanting.&nbsp; So they continued their
game&mdash;only playing for sixpences.&nbsp; When Mrs. Gillison
retired <i>that</i> night her last observation was,&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow that gurl do improve in her card
playin&rsquo; to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed Mrs. Gillison did not do her
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> more than justice.&nbsp; She did
improve with rapid strides.&nbsp; The same faculty which enabled
her to take away the village school prizes from all comers, now
gave her the power of acquiring the mysteries of the pack.&nbsp;
In time she began to consider cribbage a somewhat slow amusement,
and her mistress, nothing loath, undertook to open up for her the
beauties of <i>&eacute;cart&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; This Susan
considered an altogether more agreeable pastime.&nbsp; And after
she had played it a week her mistress on going to bed made
<i>this</i> remark,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way that gurl turns up the King is
astonishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was astonishing.&nbsp; In fact, Susan turned the King up
with such success that at the end of twelve months her mistress
owed her five hundred pounds which she could not pay.&nbsp; Then
it was that Susan discovered the sinfulness of cards.&nbsp; It
consisted in playing and not paying.&nbsp; She told her mistress
so, and considered that she was only doing her duty as a
religious and well brought-up young woman <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>in warning
that abandoned person of the danger of giving way to habits of
dishonesty.&nbsp; This little monetary difficulty occasioned
unpleasantness between mistress and maid.&nbsp; Relations between
them became strained.&nbsp; Mrs. Gillison was&mdash;to use her
own expression&mdash;dying for a game of cards, and Susan
Copeland refused to play except for ready money.&nbsp; Eventually
it became so apparent that the unscrupulous old woman either
would not or could not pay what she had lost, that Susan in the
defence of her just rights was obliged to call in her legal
adviser.</p>
<p>Thomas Ash, still true to his Susan, and pining at a
separation so lengthened, had obtained a situation in the London
police, and although he had not succeeded in getting put upon the
Thornton Heath district he felt that he was near his sweetheart,
and could occasionally have an interview with her when off
duty.&nbsp; One evening Susan told her mistress that her friend
had called, and the old lady, now looking worn and faded,
followed her maid to the kitchen, where, to her great surprise
and terror, she beheld a policeman of formidable size and severe
aspect.&nbsp; She burst <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>out crying and begged Susan to spare
her&mdash;not to arrest her and she would pay all&mdash;she would
indeed.&nbsp; Thomas Ash reassured the lady, informing her that
he was present in his private capacity to advise, not in his
public capacity to arrest.&nbsp; He was present to assist, not to
alarm.&nbsp; The advice which he gave was simple and
direct.&nbsp; He advised her to sell her house and furniture, and
so settle Susan&rsquo;s demand.&nbsp; The defaulting gambler at
first refused, but Thomas Ash put the heinousness of her crime in
such a very strong light that she at last consented, and Lambird
Cottage with its contents became the property of strangers.</p>
<p>Ash left the police and took a beer house called the
&ldquo;Spotted Cow,&rdquo; and in due course married Susan.&nbsp;
They are greatly respected by their customers, and have shown
unexampled kindness to the wretched woman, who tried to rob the
gentle Susan.&nbsp; They have, for a consideration paid
quarterly, given Mrs. Gillison a home, and she endeavours to
prove her gratitude by doing all the kitchen work, mending the
socks of the only child, and preparing the linen, for another
which is <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>daily expected.&nbsp; Sometimes Susan will lend her six
pennies of an evening with which to play cribbage, and they play
quite happily till the Paragon has won the pennies all back
again.</p>
<h2><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>XXI.<br />
<i>LOVE AND A DIARY</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will find recorded in a hundred
places the history of the flirt, who, carrying her affectation of
coldness too far, is misunderstood at last by her lover.&nbsp;
He, devoted man, leaves her presence to wander about the world,
while she atones for her indiscretion by a life-long
repentance.&nbsp; This capricious maiden figures in comedy,
tragedy, and farce.&nbsp; She is the heroine of innumerable
novels, and her folly and fidelity form the theme of at least one
popular song.&nbsp; In this Tale she figures once again; and the
only excuse for presenting her is that she appears in connection
with a circumstance or coincidence so strange as to appear
incredible.&nbsp; It is nevertheless absolutely true.</p>
<p>Those who have followed the red deer on <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Exmoor need
not be told that Dulverton is a hunting centre, situated on the
border of Somerset.&nbsp; Such readers will recall, not
unpleasantly, the morning bustle in the yard of the
&ldquo;Lion&rdquo; when there has been a meet in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The rubbing down of nags, the excitement of
grooms, the greetings of red-coated sportsmen.&nbsp; Among those
who most enthusiastically supported the Devon and Somerset Stag
hounds at the date of this story&rsquo;s commencement were Squire
Arbery and his daughter Kate.&nbsp; She was an excellent
horsewoman, and understood the long, precipitous coombes, and
knew how to take the deceptive moor-bog, which showed as solid
ground to the uninitiated, and was generally in at the death,
when the stag, with glassy eye, outstretched tongue, and
quivering flank, fell beneath the fangs of the pack.</p>
<p>Kate Arbery had performed in such scenes, times without
number, and had invariably succeeded in exciting the admiration
of the field.&nbsp; The admiration of one unfortunate wight had
developed into a passion.&nbsp; His name was Chilcott.&nbsp; The
Chilcotts were hunting men from all time, and Henry Chilcott
valued his <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>accomplishments because he believed they would give him
favour in the eyes of Miss Arbery.&nbsp; Henry was young and
enthusiastic.&nbsp; His brother Arthur, who was two years his
senior, regarded the infatuation of Henry as one of the heaviest
misfortunes which could have befallen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, Harry, she has no heart,&rdquo; he
would say to him at times.</p>
<p>But the other replied lightly that he couldn&rsquo;t see how
such an anatomical omission was possible, and fell more and more
hopelessly in love every day.&nbsp; These people belonged to the
same sphere, and opportunities for the interchange of sentiment
were frequent.&nbsp; Upon Henry Chilcott the effect of such
interchanges of sentiment with Kate Arbery varied.&nbsp;
Sometimes he would return to his home elated, beaming, and
hilarious.&nbsp; At other times he would come back down-hearted,
misanthropic, and despairing.&nbsp; And his brother, interpreting
the symptoms, knew that Kate had given him high reasons for hope,
or that she had treated him with studied coldness and
hauteur.&nbsp; Harry&rsquo;s nature was a singularly simple and
unsuspecting one.&nbsp; He attributed her varying <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>moods to
anything but the right cause.&nbsp; But after a year of assiduous
attention and of much love-making of the kind when no word of
love has been spoken, Harry Chilcott determined to know the
worst.</p>
<p>There had been a meet at Anstey Barrows, and after a long and
exciting chase the stag was killed at the Water&rsquo;s-meet on
the Lynn.&nbsp; But few of those who saw the stag break were in
at the death.&nbsp; Among those few were Kate Arbery and her
admirer.&nbsp; After they had witnessed the agreeable spectacle
of disembowelling &ldquo;the stag of ten,&rdquo; an operation
completed with great nicety and despatch by the huntsmen, they
rode together slowly in the direction of home&mdash;for their
horses were by no means so fresh as when they streamed away
towards the water from Anstey Barrows.&nbsp; Then he spoke.&nbsp;
And she, full of high spirits and the keen sense of enjoyment
born of sport, at first bantered her gallant, and then snubbed
him.&nbsp; She was simply borne away by a fine flow of animal
spirits.&nbsp; He accepted her answers seriously and in
silence.&nbsp; He had received his sentence, and he had no right
to question the wisdom of the judge.&nbsp; Though she <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>might, he
thought, have been less cruelly severe in her manner of awarding
it.</p>
<p>The grey shades of evening were closing in by the time they
reached her father&rsquo;s gates.&nbsp; As they were flung open,
Kate saw that Harry held his horse in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come up to the house, will you not?&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>He answered sorrowfully,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wish to say good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! good-bye, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shake hands with
me.&nbsp; For it is good-bye for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he been a close observer of human nature he would have
seen that Kate reddened and then turned white.&nbsp; She
recovered herself in a moment, however.&nbsp; He approached
her.&nbsp; She held out her hand.&nbsp; He bent over it and said
&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp; She felt a hot tear fall that
seemed to burn through her glove.&nbsp; But she only said with
supreme airiness of manner, &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; and galloped
up through the avenue of chestnuts.</p>
<p>Harry was as good as his word.&nbsp; He took the portion of
goods that fell to him, and went into a far country.&nbsp; And
now Miss <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Arbery began to evince an interest in Arthur Chilcott,
which she had never before exhibited.&nbsp; She made all sorts of
excuses for seeing that gentleman, and at last she did what she
might have done before, confessed her love for Harry, and
commanded his brother to bring him back to her.&nbsp; Ladies do
occasionally make preposterous demands of this sort, imagining
that it is the duty of Society at large, to repair the evil of
their own making.&nbsp; But Arthur was cynical.&nbsp; He
professed himself unable to reconcile Kate&rsquo;s expressions
with Kate&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will prove to you that I love him.&nbsp; You are his
brother.&nbsp; You shall see my diary.&nbsp; You shall read my
confessions.&nbsp; And then you will bring him back, will you
not?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>To a woman in her present state of mind, Arthur Chilcott knew
that he might as well say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; as anything
else.&nbsp; Besides which &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is more easily said
than any other word in the language.&nbsp; So he said it; and
received, with many injunctions as to strict secrecy, the
precious diary.&nbsp; It was folded up in brown paper.&nbsp; He
put it into his pocket; <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>took leave of Miss Arbery and the
Squire, and went home.</p>
<p>Arthur Chilcott, though capable of advising well when
consulted about the affairs of others, was not triumphantly
discreet in the conduct of his own.&nbsp; And soon after the
departure of his brother, he became very badly afflicted with the
mania for that species of gambling, which goes by the name of
speculation.&nbsp; He dabbled in all sorts and conditions of
stocks, and in the course of a couple of years, had muddled away
his whole fortune.&nbsp; Chilcott Manor, with the fine grounds
attached, had to be brought to the hammer.&nbsp; The pictures,
books, plate, and wines were duly entered in the unsympathetic
pages of the auctioneer, and Arthur came up to London, to live in
chambers, heartily wishing that he had never indulged in any
sport more hazardous than hunting the red-deer of Exmoor.</p>
<p>Harry Chilcott, after many wanderings in foreign lands, during
the course of which he had never forwarded an address, or any
indication of the course of his aimless adventures, arrived in
London.&nbsp; He was tolerably well cured of his passion&mdash;or
fancied that he was, <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>which is perhaps not exactly the
same thing.&nbsp; Happening to pass through Holborn one day, he
stopped at the second-hand bookshop of Mr. Whalley, and began
turning over the volumes that lay higgledy-piggledy in a deal box
bearing the intimation, &ldquo;All these at
fourpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course this intimation did not mean
that the whole boxful would be sold for that ridiculously
inadequate sum, but that each volume could be purchased for a
simple groat.&nbsp; The box contained a miscellaneous and
somewhat battered assortment of literary works.&nbsp; There was
an odd volume of Swift&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters to Stella;&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Euclid&rdquo; minus the title page; volume the fourth of
Rollin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ancient History;&rdquo; three or four
numbers of &ldquo;Blackwood;&rdquo; a &ldquo;Book of Common
Prayer&rdquo; with one clasp, an incomplete copy of &ldquo;The
Whole Duty of Man&rdquo; and&mdash;</p>
<p>And! what is this?</p>
<p>Harry Chilcott took up a little book of manuscript.&nbsp; His
hand trembled as he opened it and gazed at the handwriting.&nbsp;
He turned eagerly to the flyleaf.&nbsp; One word was written
there&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Kate</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>It
was enough.&nbsp; He ran into the shop, deposited fourpence, and
rushed with his prize to the Charing Cross Hotel, at which
establishment, probably for economical reasons, he was
staying.&nbsp; He locked himself into his room, and as he read
page after page, uttered that scrap of autobiographical
intelligence, which at some time or other most of the sons of
Adam have felt impelled to repeat&mdash;&ldquo;What a fool I have
been!&rdquo;&nbsp; Against the dates of an entire twelve months
were entries in which Kate Arbery confessed her affection;
entries in which she admitted regret that she should have teased
her lover; entries in which she vowed that she would never marry
mortal man unless Harry Chilcott asked her to be his.</p>
<p>Finally he turned to the date of the day following that upon
which he had bidden her &ldquo;good-bye for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he read thus,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Date.)&nbsp; I have not slept all night thinking of my
darling.&nbsp; How could I have been so cruel?&nbsp; He is so
patient&mdash;so kind.&nbsp; But he did not <i>mean</i>
&lsquo;good-bye.&rsquo;&nbsp; It cannot be.&nbsp; I <i>must</i>
see him.&nbsp; You will come back to me, Harry, I <i>know</i> you
will.&nbsp; I could cry my eyes out with vexation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>And
so on.</p>
<p>The infatuated man shut the book, and absolutely shouted with
exultation,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; Kate, I have got your message, and I fly to
your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before carrying into effect this resolution he purchased
garments more suitable to the accepted lover than the rough, and,
indeed, eccentric clothes which he had picked up on his
travels.&nbsp; Then he wrote to his brother Arthur, believing
that unhappy speculator still to be in the neighbourhood of
Dulverton, and the following evening he and his portmanteau were
delivered safe and sound at the door of the
&ldquo;Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was great commotion in the
principal room of that famous inn.&nbsp; Indeed, a high carousal
was being carried on, and loud songs and louder laughter filled
the establishment.&nbsp; Harry was in high spirits himself, and
would have joined the hilarious farmers had it not been that the
waiter, who conducted him to his room, informed him that the
roysterers downstairs were celebrating the marriage of Miss Kate
Arbery to Parson Snowe, a ceremony which had been performed that
morning in the parish church.</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>For
about an hour the disappointed lover sat silent.&nbsp; Then he
took the Diary and wrote in it, &ldquo;A wedding present for
Parson Snowe.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrapped the volume up, addressed it
to the reverend bridegroom, and trudged to the post-office with
it.&nbsp; Arrived there, however, his better nature
triumphed.&nbsp; He went back to the &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; and
undoing the packet turned once more to the page in which Kate
commanded him to come back.&nbsp; He reverently kissed the
entry.&nbsp; Then he thrust Kate&rsquo;s Diary into the flames,
and silently watched it burn away to white ashes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
